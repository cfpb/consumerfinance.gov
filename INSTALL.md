# Installation and Configuration for cfgov-refresh

There are two ways to install:
 - [Vagrant-box installation](INSTALL.md#vagrant-box-installation)
 - [Stand-alone installation](INSTALL.md#stand-alone-installation)

## Vagrant-box installation

### 1. Environment variables setup

The project uses a number of environment variables.
The `setup.sh` script will create a `.env` file for you
from the `.env_SAMPLE` file found in the repository,
if you don't already have one:

```sh
./setup.sh
```

Inside the `.env` file you can customize the project environment configuration.

If you would like to manually copy the environment settings,
copy the `.env_SAMPLE` file and un-comment each variable after
adding your own values.
```bash
cp -a .env_SAMPLE .env && open -t .env
```

Then load the environment variables with:
```bash
. ./.env
```

### 2. Fetch extra playbooks

The project pulls together various open source and closed source plays. The plays are
managed through ansible-galaxy, a core module for this exact purpose. To download all
the dependencies, use this command:

```bash
ansible-galaxy install -r ansible/requirements.yml
```

### 3. Launch Vagrant virtual environment

The project uses Vagrant to create the simulated virtual environment allowing the developer
to work on a production-like environment while maintaining development work on the
local machine. To create this virtual environment, you need to execute the following command.

```bash
vagrant up
```

> **NOTE:** Please be patient the first time you run this step.

### 4. Front-end Tools

In order to run the application, we must generate the front-end assets.
After running the following commands, visit http://localhost:8001 to see the site running.
You can also place the first two export commands into your `.bashrc` to simplify things later.

```bash
export CFGOV_HOME=path/to/cfgov-refresh
export PATH=$PATH:$CFGOV_HOME/bin
cfgov init
cfgov assets
cfgov start django
```

## Stand-alone installation

### 1. Environment variables setup

The project uses a number of environment variables.
The `setup.sh` script will create a `.env` file for you
from the `.env_SAMPLE` file found in the repository,
if you don't already have one:

```sh
./setup.sh
```

### 2. Back-end setup

#### Virtualenv & Virtualenvwrapper Python modules

Install [Virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/index.html) and
[virtualenvwrapper](https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.org/en/latest/)
to create a local environment for your server:
```bash
pip install virtualenv virtualenvwrapper
```

#### Autoenv module

[Install Autoenv](https://github.com/kennethreitz/autoenv#install) however you’d like.
(We use [Homebrew](http://brew.sh)):

Run:
```bash
brew install autoenv
```

After installation, Homebrew will output instructions similar to:
```bash
To finish the installation, source activate.sh in your shell:
  source /Users/[YOUR MAC OSX USERNAME]/homebrew/opt/autoenv/activate.sh
```

Any time you run the project you’ll need to run that last line. If you’ll be working with
the project consistently, we suggest adding it to your bash profile by running:
```bash
echo 'source /Users/[YOUR MAC OSX USERNAME]/homebrew/opt/autoenv/activate.sh' >> ~/.bash_profile
```

If you need to find this info again later, you can run:
```bash
brew info autoenv
```

> **NOTE:** If you use ZSH you’ll need to use [zsh-autoenv](https://github.com/Tarrasch/zsh-autoenv),
  but we can’t provide support for issues that may arise.

#### Elasticsearch

[Install Elasticsearch 1.7](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/1.7/setup.html)
however you’d like. (We use [Homebrew](http://brew.sh)):
```bash
brew tap homebrew/versions
brew search elasticsearch
brew install homebrew/versions/elasticsearch17
```

Just as with autoenv, Homebrew will output similar instructions after installation:

```bash
To have launchd start homebrew/versions/elasticsearch17 now and restart at login:
  brew services start homebrew/versions/elasticsearch17
Or, if you don't want/need a background service you can just run:
  elasticsearch --config=/Users/[YOUR MAC OSX USERNAME]/homebrew/opt/elasticsearch17/config/elasticsearch.yml
```

Any time you work on the project, you’ll need to open a new tab and run that last line.
If you’ll be working on the project consistently, we suggest using the first option. Note that some older versions of Homebrew may suggest using `launchctl` instead of `brew services`.

If you need to find this info again later, you can run:
```bash
brew info elasticsearch17
```

### MYSQL Database
Start MYSQL with the following command:
```
mysql.server start
```

Then run the MYSQL creation script from project root directory:
```
./create-mysql-db.sh
```

If you would like to have a custom database setup
then you can pass in the necessary arguments:

```
./create-mysql-db.sh <dbname> <username> <password>
```

> **NOTE:** Be sure to update your local settings in
  `cfgov/cfgov/settings/local.py` to account for these changes.


If something goes wrong and you'd like to delete the database
and start again, you can do so with:

```
mysql v1 -u root -p -e 'drop database v1;'
```

#### Virtual Environment
In the project root directory,
create a virtualenv that you’ll name `cfgov-refresh`:
```bash
mkvirtualenv cfgov-refresh
```

The new virtualenv will activate right away. To activate it later on
(say, in a new terminal session) use the command `workon cfgov-refresh`.
You’ll know you have a virtual environment activated if you see the name of it in
parentheses before your terminal prompt. Ex:
```bash
(cfgov-refresh)$
```

#### GovDelivery

Install the following GovDelivery dependencies into your virtual environment:
```bash
pip install git+git://github.com/dpford/flask-govdelivery
pip install git+git://github.com/rosskarchner/govdelivery
```

> **NOTE:** GovDelivery is a third-party web service that powers our subscription forms.
  Users may decide to swap this tool out for another third-party service.
  The application will throw an error
  if the GovDelivery environment variables are not set
  in the [Project Configuration](https://github.com/cfpb/cfgov-refresh/blob/flapjack/INSTALL.md#4-project-configuration).


## 3. Front-end setup

The cfgov-refresh front-end currently uses the following frameworks / tools:

- [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com): task management for pulling in assets,
  linting and concatenating code, etc.
- [Bower](http://bower.io): Package manager for front-end dependencies.
- [Less](http://lesscss.org): CSS pre-processor.
- [Capital Framework](https://cfpb.github.io/capital-framework/getting-started):
  User interface pattern-library produced by the CFPB.

> **NOTE:** If you’re new to Capital Framework, we encourage you to
  [start here](https://cfpb.github.io/capital-framework/getting-started).

1. Install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) however you’d like. This project requires version 5.5.0 and up.
2. Install [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com) and [Bower](http://bower.io):

```bash
npm install -g gulp bower
```

## 4. Install dependencies

> **NOTE:**
  Protractor (for the test suite)
  can be installed globally to avoid downloading Chromedriver repeatedly.
  To do so, run:
  ```bash
  npm install -g protractor && webdriver-manager update
  ```

> **NOTE:**
  To re-install and rebuild all the site’s assets run `./setup.sh` again.
  See the usage section
  [updating all the project dependencies](README.md#updating-all-dependencies).


## 5. Project configuration

The project uses a number of environment variables.
The `setup.sh` script will create a `.env` file for you
from the `.env_SAMPLE` file found in the repository,
if you don't already have one.

Inside the `.env` file you can customize the project environment configuration.

If you would like to manually copy the environment settings,
copy the `.env_SAMPLE` file and un-comment each variable after
adding your own values.
```bash
cp -a .env_SAMPLE .env && open .env
```

Then load the environment variables with:
```bash
. ./.env
```

If you need to test this project without Autoenv,
you can set each environment variable
by directly setting its value from the command-line with:
```
export [CONSTANTNAME]=[CONSTANTVALUE]
```
