Feature: Test 8: Basic HB behavior with VA - Purpose: check for correct behavior when you trigger a VA HB loan.
  As a first time visitor to the Rate Checker page
  I want to see FHA High Balance alerts
  So that I can make informed choices when shopping for an FHA loan

Background:
  Given I navigate to the "Rate Checker" page

@high_balance
Scenario Outline: Triggering conventional via FHA high-balance
  When I select "<state_name>" as State
    And I select "VA" Loan Type
    And I enter $"500,000" as House Price amount
  Then I should see the chart faded out to indicate the data is out of date
    And I should see a County alert "Based on your loan amount, you may not be eligible for a regular VA loan. Please enter your county so we can find the right loan type for you and get you the most accurate rates."
    And I should see the County field highlighted

Examples:
| state_name      |
| California      |
| Colorado        |
| Florida         |
| Idaho           |
| Maryland        |
| North Carolina  |
| Virginia        |
| Washington      |

  When I select "<state_name>" as State

    And I enter $"500,000" as House Price amount
    #And I wait "10" seconds and do nothing
