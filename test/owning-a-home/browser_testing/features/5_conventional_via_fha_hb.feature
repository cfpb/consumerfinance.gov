Feature: Test 5: Triggering conventional via FHA high-balance + increase in house price - Purpose: This test looks for correct behavior in triggering a conventional loan, via an FHA high-balance loan and an increase in house price
  As a first time visitor to the Rate Checker page

Scenario Outline: Triggering conventional via FHA high-balance
  When I select "<state_name>" as State
    And I enter $"310,000" as House Price amount
    And I select "FHA" Loan Type
  Then I should see the chart faded out to indicate the data is out of date
    And I should see a County alert "Based on your loan amount, you may not be eligible for a regular FHA loan. Please enter your county so we can find the right loan type for you and get you the most accurate rates."
    And I should see the County field highlighted

Examples:
| state_name    |
| Georgia       |
| Illinois      |
| Oregon        |
| Pennsylvania  |
| Wisconsin     |
| New Mexico    |
| North Dakota  |
| Connecticut   |
