Feature: Test 11: VA to jumbo triggers, basic - Purpose: check for correct behavior when you trigger a VA HB loan, but that is not available, and you get kicked out to jumbo.

	As a first time visitor to the Rate Checker page
  	I want to see FHA High Balance alerts
  	So that I can make informed choices when shopping for an FHA loan

Background:
	Given I navigate to the "Rate Checker" page

@high_balance
Scenario Outline:
	When I select "<state_name>" as State
		And I select "VA" Loan Type
		And I enter "20" as Down Payment percent
		And I enter $"800,000" as House Price amount
	Then I should see the chart faded out to indicate the data is out of date
		And I should see a County alert "Based on your loan amount, you may not be eligible for a regular VA loan. Please enter your county so we can find the right loan type for you and get you the most accurate rates."
		And I should see the County field highlighted  

Examples:
| state_name 		| 
| California 		|
| Colorado 			|
| Florida 			|
| Idaho 			|
| Maryland 			|
| North Carolina 	|
| Virginia 			|
| Washington        |

		And I enter "20" as Down Payment percent
		And I enter $"800,000" as House Price amount
		And I select <county_name> County
	Then I should see the chart active with new data
		And I should see "Jumbo (non-conforming)" as the selected Loan Type
		And I should see the Loan Type field highlighted
		And I should see an HB alert "While VA loans do not have strict loan limits, most lenders are unlikely to make a VA loan more than <VA_max_loan_amount> in your county. Your only option may be a jumbo (non-conforming) loan."
		But I should NOT see a County alert "Based on your loan amount, you may not be eligible for a regular VA loan. Please enter your county so we can find the right loan type for you and get you the most accurate rates."
		But I should NOT see the County field highlighted

Examples:
| state_name 		| county_name 			| VA_max_loan_amount 	| 
| California 		| Mono County 			| $529,000 				|
