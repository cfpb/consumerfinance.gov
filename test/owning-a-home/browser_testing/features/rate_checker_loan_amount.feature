  As a first time visitor to the Rate Checker page
  I want to enter house price and interest rate
  So that I can estimate my loan amount

Background:
  Given I navigate to the "Rate Checker" page

Scenario Outline: Calculate loan amount based on house price and down payment amount
  When I enter $"<house_price>" as House Price amount 
    And I enter $"<down_payment_amount>" as Down Payment amount
  Then I should see "<loan_amount>" as Loan Amount

Examples:
  | house_price     | down_payment_amount  | loan_amount |
  | 100,000         | 20,000 		           | $80,000 	   |
  | 250,000         | 42,500 		           | $207,500	   |
  | 780,000		      | 68,640 		           | $711,360    | 
  | 1,250,000	      | 187,500 	           | $1,062,500  |
  | 200,000         | 20,000               | $180,000    |

  | house_price   | down_payment_percent   | down_payment_amount |
  | 250,000       | 17                     | 42500               |

Scenario Outline: Enter then modify down payment percent
  When I enter $"<house_price>" as House Price amount
    And I enter "<initial_percent>" as Down Payment percent
    And I change the Down Payment percent to "<modified_percent>"

Scenario Outline: Modify down payment amount
  When I enter $"<house_price>" as House Price amount
