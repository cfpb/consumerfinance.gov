Feature: Test 6: Changing loan types - Purpose: check for correct behavior when you change the loan type in the $275,665 - $424,100 range in counties with FHA-HB available.
  As a first time visitor to the Rate Checker page
  I want to see FHA High Balance alerts
  So that I can make informed choices when shopping for an FHA loan

Background:
  Given I navigate to the "Rate Checker" page

Scenario Outline: Triggering conventional via FHA high-balance
  When I select "<state_name>" as State
    And I enter $"350,000" as House Price amount
    And I select "FHA" Loan Type
  Then I should see the chart faded out to indicate the data is out of date
    And I should see a County alert "Based on your loan amount, you may not be eligible for a regular FHA loan. Please enter your county so we can find the right loan type for you and get you the most accurate rates."
    And I should see the County field highlighted

Examples:
| state_name     |
| Georgia 		   |
| Illinois 		   |
| Maryland 		   |
| New Jersey 	   |
| Oregon 		     |
| Pennsylvania 	 |
| Virginia 		   |
| Wisconsin 	   |
| Georgia 		   |
