Scenario Outline: Select different Loan Types and Loan Terms for Fixed Rate loans
  When I select "<rate_structure>" Rate Structure
  	And I select "<loan_type>" Loan Type
    And I select "<loan_term> Years" Loan Term
  Then I should see primary Interest costs over the first "5" years
    And I should see primary Interest costs over "<loan_term>" years

  When I select "<rate_structure>" Rate Structure
