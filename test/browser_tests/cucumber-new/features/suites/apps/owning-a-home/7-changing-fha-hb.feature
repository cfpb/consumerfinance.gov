Feature: Test 7: Changing loan types - Purpose: check for correct behavior when you change the loan type before choosing a county after triggering FHA HB
  As a first time visitor to the Rate Checker page
  I want to see FHA High Balance alerts
  So that I can make informed choices when shopping for an FHA loan

Background:
  Given I navigate to the "Rate Checker" page

@high_balance
Scenario Outline: Triggering FHA high-balance
  When I select "<state_name>" as State
	 And I enter $"350,000" as House Price amount
    And I select "FHA" Loan Type
  Then I should see the chart faded out to indicate the data is out of date
    And I should see a County alert "Based on your loan amount, you may not be eligible for a regular FHA loan. Please enter your county so we can find the right loan type for you and get you the most accurate rates."
	 And I should see the County field highlighted

Examples:
| state_name    |
| Georgia       | 
| Illinois      | 
| Maryland      | 
| New Jersey    | 
| Oregon        | 
| Pennsylvania  |
| Virginia      | 
| Wisconsin     | 
| Georgia       | 
| Illinois      | 
| Maryland      | 
| New Jersey    | 
| Oregon        | 
| Pennsylvania  | 
| Virginia      | 
| Wisconsin     |

Scenario Outline: Changing Loan Type
  When I select "<state_name>" as State
    And I enter $"350,000" as House Price amount
    And I select "FHA" Loan Type
    And I change to "<new_loan_type>" Loan Type
  Then I should see the chart active with new data
    But I should NOT see a County alert "Based on your loan amount, you may not be eligible for a regular FHA loan. Please enter your county so we can find the right loan type for you and get you the most accurate rates."
    But I should NOT see the County selection
