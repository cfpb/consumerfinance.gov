Feature: Test the "Credit score range" slider
  As a first time visitor to the Rate Checker page
  I want to enter my credit score
  So that I can view my loan rate options

Background:
  Given I navigate to the "Rate Checker" page

@credit_score @rate_checker
Scenario: Decrease credit score range
  When I move the credit score slider to the "left"
  Then I should see the credit score range "decrease"

@credit_score @rate_checker
Scenario: Increase credit score range
  When I move the credit score slider to the "right"
  Then I should see the credit score range "increase"

@credit_score @rate_checker
Scenario: Lowest credit score range
  When I move the credit score slider to the "lowest" range
  Then I should see the Credit Score Range displayed as "600 - 619"

@credit_score @rate_checker
Scenario: Highest credit score range
  When I move the credit score slider to the "highest" range
  Then I should see the Credit Score Range displayed as "840 - 850"

@credit_score @rate_checker
Scenario: Lowest credit score range alerts
  When I move the credit score slider to the "lowest" range
  Then I should see the credit score slider handle turns "red"
    And I should see an alert for borowers with less than 620 score

@credit_score @rate_checker
Scenario: Lowest credit score range alerts go away when score range increases
  When I move the credit score slider to the "lowest" range
  	And I move the credit score slider to the "right"
  Then I should see the credit score slider handle turns "green"
    And I should NOT see an alert for borowers with less than 620 score
