Feature: Test 2: Triggering conventional via FHA
  As a first time visitor to the Rate Checker page
  I want to see FHA High Balance alerts
  So that I can make informed choices when shopping for an FHA loan

Background:
  Given I navigate to the "Rate Checker" page

Scenario Outline: Triggering a Conventional loan when FHA high balance is not available
  When I select "<state_name>" as State
    And I enter $"350,000" as House Price amount
    And I select "FHA" Loan Type
  Then I should see the chart faded out to indicate the data is out of date
    And I should see a County alert "Based on your loan amount, you may not be eligible for a regular FHA loan. Please enter your county so we can find the right loan type for you and get you the most accurate rates."
    And I should see the County field highlighted

Examples:
| state_name 	|
| Alabama 	 	|
| Arizona    	|
| Colorado   	|
| Florida    	|
| Indiana    	|
| Utah        |
| Kansas      |
| Montana     |

    And I should see the Loan Type field highlighted
    And I should see an HB alert "You are not eligible for an FHA loan when you borrow more than <FHA_max_loan_amount> in your county. You are eligible for a conventional loan."
