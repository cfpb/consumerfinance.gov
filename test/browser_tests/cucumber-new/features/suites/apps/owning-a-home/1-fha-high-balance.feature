Scenario Outline: Trigger the County warning
	When I select "<state_name>" as State
		And I enter $"350,000" as House Price amount
  		And I select "FHA" Loan Type
  	Then I should see the chart faded out to indicate the data is out of date
  		And I should see a County alert "Based on your loan amount, you may not be eligible for a regular FHA loan. Please enter your county so we can find the right loan type for you and get you the most accurate rates."
    	And I should see the County field highlighted

Examples:
	| state_name 	|
	| Georgia 		|
	| Illinois 		|
	| Maryland 		|
	| New Jersey 	|
	| Oregon 		|
	| Pennsylvania 	|
	| Virginia 		|
	| Wisconsin     |
