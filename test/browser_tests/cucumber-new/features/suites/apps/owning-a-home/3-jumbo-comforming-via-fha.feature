Feature: Test 3: Triggering conforming jumbo via FHA - Purpose: This test looks for correct behavior in triggering a conforming jumbo loan when FHA high balance is not available.
  As a first time visitor to the Rate Checker page
  I want to see Jumbo conforming alerts
  So that I can make informed choices when shopping for an FHA loan

Background:
  Given I navigate to the "Rate Checker" page

Scenario Outline: Trigger conforming jumbo loan
  When I select "<state_name>" as State
	  And I select "FHA" Loan Type
    And I enter $"500,000" as House Price amount
  Then I should see the chart faded out to indicate the data is out of date
    And I should see a County alert "Based on your loan amount, you may not be eligible for a regular FHA loan. Please enter your county so we can find the right loan type for you and get you the most accurate rates." 
    And I should see the County field highlighted 

Examples:
| state_name | 
| Hawaii     | 
| Utah       | 
| Alaska     |

  When I select "<state_name>" as State
    And I select "FHA" Loan Type
    And I enter $"500,000" as House Price amount
    And I select <county_name> County
  Then I should see the chart active with new data
    And I should see "Conforming jumbo" as the selected Loan Type
    And I should see the Loan Type field highlighted
    And I should see an HB alert "You are not eligible for an FHA loan when you borrow more than <FHA_max_loan_amount> in your county. You are eligible for a conforming jumbo loan."
    But I should NOT see a County alert "Based on your loan amount, you may not be eligible for a regular FHA loan. Please enter your county so we can find the right loan type for you and get you the most accurate rates."
    But I should NOT see the County field highlighted

Examples:
| state_name | county_name            | FHA_max_loan_amount |
| Hawaii     | Hawaii County          | $368,000            |
| Utah       | Tooele County          | $312,800            |
| Alaska     | Anchorage Municipality | $391,000            |
