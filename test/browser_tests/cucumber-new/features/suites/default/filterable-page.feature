Feature: Filterable
  As a user of cf.gov
  I expect to see all results when I haven't selected a filter

  Scenario: Sublanding filterable page
  	Given I goto URL "/about-us/blog/"
  	But I do not select a filter
    Then I should not see filtered results

  Scenario: Browse filterable page
  	Given I goto URL "/policy-compliance/rulemaking/final-rules/"
  	But I do not select a filter
    Then I should not see filtered results
