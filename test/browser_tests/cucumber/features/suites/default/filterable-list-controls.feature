Feature: Filterable list controls
	As a visitor to cf.gov
	I expect to be able to filter lists based on the content relevant to me

# The tests assume some blog posts already exist, and will need some test post data if they're run locally.
# This includes at least one post that contains the word "loan" in the title, one post without the word "loan" in the title,
# posts published both before and after the date 01/01/2017. The posts should be in several different categories,
# and tagged with several different topic tags, including at least one with the tag "mortgages" and at least one without the "mortgages" tag.
# The posts should also have several different authors, including at least one with the author "CFPB Web Team".
