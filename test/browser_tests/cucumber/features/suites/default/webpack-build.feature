Feature: Webpack-build
  As a front-end developer
  I should ensure the build is transpiled correctly

  Background:
    Given I run gulp build to generate JS bundles

  @webpack
  Scenario: The following transpilers should have run:
              check-es2015-constants
              transform-es2015-arrow-functions
    #Regex test: https://regex101.com/r/BBC1pS/2
    Then the JS bundles shouldn't contain double arrows or constants
