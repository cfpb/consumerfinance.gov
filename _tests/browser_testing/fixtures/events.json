We decided to write a series of posts that explain some key parts of the rulemaking process. We’ll add to the series in the coming weeks and months.</p>\n<p>Before we propose a rule, we’re sometimes required to organize a Small Business Review Panel so that we can hear from small businesses about the potential impacts of the rule. We’re one of three federal regulators required to include the small business review process. Small businesses provide us with valuable feedback as we write regulations to help consumer financial products and services work for Americans.</p>\n<h3>How we work with small businesses</h3>\n<p>We’re a data-driven, evidence-based agency with a philosophy of issuing regulations only where there’s a strong justification for doing so. The Dodd-Frank Act, the law that created the CFPB, requires us to organize a Small Business Review Panel when we’re working on a rule that could have significant economic impacts on small entities. Small entities include small businesses, organizations, and small government bodies</p>\n<p>Each Small Business Review Panel consists of representatives from the CFPB, Small Business Administration, and the Office of Management and Budget’s Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs. The panel holds an outreach meeting with a representative group of small businesses to discuss the potential rules we’re considering. We’ll use that feedback to inform the rulemaking process.</p>\n<h3>The panel decides which small businesses participate</h3>\n<p>First, we determine which types of small entities the proposed rule under consideration could directly affect. Then, we coordinate with the Small Business Administration to select individuals to represent these small entities. About 15 to 20 small business representatives usually participate in the process.</p>\n<h3>How the panel works</h3>\n<p>Before the outreach meeting, the panel will distribute materials to each participant, including general background, an overview of the proposals being considered, and a list of issues and questions we’ll discuss with the participants. We post these materials on our web site simultaneously so our rulemaking plans are transparent.</p>\n<p>Small business representatives are given time to study the materials and we follow up with them to see if they have questions. Then, during the meeting, the panel hears from the representatives about the regulatory proposals. Representatives typically discuss the anticipated compliance requirements and potential costs of the proposed rule. In addition to providing verbal feedback during the meeting, the small business representatives may submit written comments.</p>\n<h3>Panel meetings</h3>\n<p>The panel’s meetings aren’t public, but we’ll publish meeting materials on our website. We want a free and open discussion with the small business representatives, and we think the best way to do that is to keep the meetings small. We&#8217;ll summarize our discussions in the panel report.</p>\n<h3>What happens next</h3>\n<p>Within 60 days of meeting, the panel will complete a report on the input we received from the small business representatives. The report may include any significant alternatives that would minimize economic impacts. We’ll publish the panel’s report along with a proposed rule, which is the next step in the rulemaking process. We’ll keep seeking feedback from consumers, consumer advocates, other regulators, and industry representatives that were not part of the panel process as we develop a proposed rule.</p>\n",

We’ve heard that some retirees with pensions who are facing financial challenges have responded to ads for cash advances on their pensions. Although pension advances may seem like a “quick fix” to your financial problems, they can eat into your retirement income when you start paying back the advance plus interest and fees.</p>\n<p>A pension advance is a cash advance in exchange for a portion, or all, of your future pension payments. Pension advance companies typically charge high interest rates and fees and often target government retirees with pensions. Former servicemembers should also be on guard. Military retirees and veterans who receive monetary benefits from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) have been offered pension advances even though it’s illegal for lenders to take a military pension or veterans’ benefits. Many of those companies use patriotic-sounding names or logos and even claim they are endorsed by the VA as a way of enticing potential customers.</p>\n<p>If you or a loved one is considering a pension advance, consider your alternatives. A financial coach or credit counselor can help you weigh your options and plan for new or unexpected financial demands. The National Foundation for Credit Counseling (NFCC) provides a <a href=\"https://www.nfcc.org/agency-locator/\">list of member agencies around the country</a>. You can also search for <a href=\"http://www.credithelp4u.org/members.cfm\">local credit counseling</a> agencies on the Association of Independent Consumer Credit Counseling Agencies (AICCA)’s website.</p>\n<p><strong>Here are 3 things you can do to protect your retirement pension:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Avoid loans with high fees and interest</strong>. Pension advance companies may not always advertise their fees and interest rates, but you will certainly feel them in your bottom line. Before you sign anything, learn what you are getting and how much you are giving up.</li>\n<li><strong>Don’t sign over control of your benefits.</strong> Companies sometimes arrange for monthly payments to be automatically deposited in a newly created bank account so the company can withdraw payments, fees and interest charges from the account. This leaves you with little control.</li>\n<li><strong>Don’t buy life insurance that you don’t want or need.</strong> Pension advance companies sometimes require consumers to sign up for life insurance with the company as the consumer’s beneficiary. If you sign up for life insurance with the pension advance company as your beneficiary, you could end up footing the bill, whether you know it or not.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>You can also get a <a href=\"/f/201503_cfpb_protect-your-retirement-pension.pdf\">printer-friendly version</a> of this information to share with friends or clients who are considering pension advances.</p>\n<p>If you know someone who’s received a pension advance offer, we want to hear about their experiences, good and bad. Please ask them to share their story at <a href=\"/your-story/\">consumerfinance.gov/your-story/</a>.</p>\n",

And young people often go to a bank to open an account when they get their first job and start earning money.</p>\n<p>However, when trying to open an account for a child under age 18, some people run into roadblocks.</p>\n<p>Whose name should the account be in? Who has to sign for it? Questions like these can be hard for the young person, the parent or caregiver, and even for the bank or credit union. This could mean that some children and teenagers are missing out on this important way to build their financial future.</p>\n<h3>Clarifying the rules</h3>\n<p>To help, federal banking regulators have <a href=\"http://www.occ.gov/news-issuances/news-releases/2015/nr-ia-2015-27a.pdf\">issued guidance</a> for banks and credit unions when they’re asked to open savings accounts for children under age 18.</p>\n<p>For parents, this means:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Youth savings accounts are protected by the same federal consumer protection laws and regulations as other accounts.</li>\n<li>More schools may be working with local financial institutions to provide financial education and opportunities for children to open accounts. The new guidance explains the federal rules on when accounts can be opened at school.</li>\n<li>Some states may not allow minors to open their own accounts. However, a parent can still open an account for the child and can consider putting both names on the account.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Teaching kids about money and saving</h3>\n<p>Financial skills are important in life and getting kids started early with good financial habits and savings can make a big impact on their financial futures. We’ve got some <a href=\"/askcfpb/search/?q=&amp;selected_facets=audience_exact%3AParents\">answers to your questions about teaching kids the money basics</a> and <a href=\"/parents\">ideas for how to get started.</a></p>\n",

    "content": "<p><a href=\"http://content.consumerfinance.gov/blog/we-took-a-look-at-arbitration-agreements-and-heres-what-we-found/\"></a>Tens of millions of consumers use financial products or services like credit cards and student loans that include pre-dispute arbitration clauses in their agreements. This means that either party to these contracts can require disputes be resolved through arbitration, rather than through the court system.  </p>\n<p>These clauses are controversial. Critics of these clauses argue that they limit consumers’ ability to take their dispute to court – particularly class actions, which allow large numbers of people to seek relief together. Advocates of these clauses, on the other hand, say arbitration is quicker and more cost-effective than court proceedings.  </p>\n<h3>What we covered</h3>\n<p>Since 2012, we’ve being working on <a href=\"/reports/arbitration-study-report-to-congress-2015/\">a study of arbitration provisions and report to Congress,</a> which was required  by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010(Dodd-Frank Act). We’ve examined pre-dispute arbitration clauses in a number of different product markets:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Credit cards</li>\n<li>Checking accounts</li>\n<li>Payday and other small dollar loans</li>\n<li>General purpose reloadable prepaid cards</li>\n<li>Private student loans</li>\n<li>Auto purchase loans and</li>\n<li>Mobile wireless agreements</li>\n</ul>\n<p>After considering dozens of comment letters and meetings with external stakeholders, we looked at nearly 850 consumer-finance agreements to examine the prevalence of arbitration clauses and their terms. We also reviewed more than 1,800 consumer finance arbitration disputes filed over a period of three years and more than 3,400 individual federal court lawsuits. We also looked at 42,000 credit card cases filed in selected small claims court in 2012.</p>\n<p>We supplemented this research by assembling and analyzing a set of roughly 420 consumer financial class action settlements in federal courts over a period of five years and over 1,100 state and federal public enforcement actions in the consumer finance area. We also conducted a national survey of 1,000 consumers with credit cards concerning their knowledge and understanding of arbitration and other dispute resolution mechanisms.</p>\n<p>We believe this is the most thorough empirical research on this subject, to date.</p>\n<h3>What we found</h3>\n<p>Through this research, we’ve learned that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Arbitration agreements affect a large number of consumers – for instance, as much as half of all credit card debt and checking account deposits are subject to arbitration agreements.</li>\n<li>Three out of four consumers surveyed did not know if they were subject to an arbitration clause.</li>\n<li>Consumers are very reluctant to bring claims against companies on their own, particularly small claims.</li>\n<li>Roughly 32 million consumers on average are eligible for relief through consumer financial class action settlements each year.</li>\n<li>We found no evidence that arbitration clauses lead to lower prices for consumers.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Why it matters</h3>\n<p>Now that the report is complete, we’re going to spend time reviewing the results in order to determine next steps. The Dodd-Frank Act gives us the ability to issue regulations on the use of arbitration clauses in consumer finance markets if we find that doing so is in the public interest and for the protection of consumers.</p>\n<p>To learn more about pre-dispute arbitration clauses and our findings check out our <a href=\"/reports/arbitration-study-report-to-congress-2015/\">full report</a>  to Congress.
