There are two primary ways to help:
 - Using the issue tracker, andâ€¦
 - Changing the codebase.


## Using the issue tracker

Use the issue tracker to suggest feature requests, report bugs, and ask questions.
This is also a great way to connect with the developers of the project as well
as others who are interested in this solution.

Use the issue tracker to find ways to contribute.
Find a bug or a feature, mention in the issue that you will take on that effort,
then follow the _Changing the codebase_ guidance below.


## Changing the codebase

If you are a contributor from outside of CFPB, you should fork this repository,
make changes in your own fork, and then submit a pull request.

If you are a contributor within CFPB, you may also fork, or follow our
[documentation for branching](https://cfpb.github.io/consumerfinance.gov/branching-merging/).

For timely code reviews of pull requests, please tag @cfpb/cfgov-backends and
@cfpb/cfgov-frontends as appropriate for your changes.

All new code should have associated unit tests and/or functional tests that
validate implemented features and the presence or lack of defects.
The overall test coverage of the codebase should not decrease.

Python code is expected to follow
[PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) and
[not commit atrocities](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf-BqAjZb8M).
JavaScript, CSS/Less, and markup should follow our
[front-end standards](https://github.com/cfpb/development).
When in doubt, mimic the styles and patterns in the existing codebase.

### Browser support

- We serve JavaScript to any browser that
[supports Promises](https://caniuse.com/promises).
We use [esbuild](https://github.com/evanw/esbuild) to transpile
and minify our JavaScript.

- We prefix CSS for [every browser in our browserslist](https://github.com/cfpb/consumerfinance.gov/blob/main/package.json#L18).
We use [autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer) to add
vendor-specific prefixes to rules where necessary.

#### Outputting browser support metrics

Within the root directory, run `npx browserslist` to output the set of browser
targets given to `autoprefixer` (CSS) transpiling.

!!! note
  A browserslist string is used in `package.json`.
  See the
  [browserslist docs](https://github.com/browserslist/browserslist#full-list)
  for information on this string and the defaults.

For JavaScript, `esbuild` uses the [`es6`](http://es6-features.org/) target and
our code conditionally includes JavaScript in browsers that
[support Promises](https://caniuse.com/promises).

!!! note
  JavaScript may still
  be delivered to legacy browsers in the form of our analytics and
  related scripts.

#### Browser Testing

We run automated browser tests in headless Chrome with `yarn cypress run`.
See our [cross browser testing docs](https://cfpb.github.io/consumerfinance.gov/other-front-end-testing/#cross-browser-testing) for other testing methods.

#### Satellite app assets

Satellite apps may run within consumerfinance.gov, but manage their own assets
within the
[unprocessed/apps](https://github.com/cfpb/consumerfinance.gov/tree/main/cfgov/unprocessed/apps)
directory. These apps can have their own dependencies within their package.json file.
