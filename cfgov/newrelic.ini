#
# This file configures the New Relic Python Agent.
#
# The path to the configuration file should be specified in the
# NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE environment variable.
#
# The configuration file follows a structure similar to what you would
# find for Microsoft Windows INI files. For further information on the
# configuration file format see the Python ConfigParser documentation at:
#
#    http://docs.python.org/library/configparser.html
#
# For further discussion on the behaviour of the Python agent that can
# be configured via this configuration file see:
#
#    http://newrelic.com/docs/python/python-agent-configuration
#
# This file was initially generated using "newrelic-admin generate-config"
# as documented at:
#
#    https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/agents/python-agent/installation
#
# It was then edited and augmented with additional configuration settings.
#

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Here are the settings that are common to all environments.

[newrelic]
# Use New Relic's FedRAMP-compliant endpoint
# https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/fedramp-compliant-endpoints
host = gov-collector.newrelic.com

# You must specify the license key associated with your New
# Relic account. This key binds the Python Agent's data to your
# account in the New Relic service.
#
# This must be specified in the NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY environment
# variable.
# license_key = <provided in environment>

# The application name. Set this to be the name of your
# application as you would like it to show up in New Relic UI.
# The UI will then auto-map instances of your application into a
# entry on your home dashboard page.
#
# This must be specified in the NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME environment
# variable.
# app_name = <provided in environment>

# When "true", the agent collects performance data about your
# application and reports this data to the New Relic UI at
# newrelic.com. This global switch is normally overridden for
# each environment below.

# Sets the name of a file to log agent messages to. Useful for
# debugging any issues with the agent. This is not set by
# default as it is not known in advance what user your web
# application processes will run as and where they have
# permission to write to. Whatever you set this to you must
# ensure that the permissions for the containing directory and
# the file itself are correct, and that the user that your web
# application runs as can write to the file. If not able to
# write out a log file, it is also possible to say "stderr" and
# output to standard error output. This would normally result in
# output appearing in your web server log.
#
# This must be specified in the NEW_RELIC_LOG environment variable.
# log_file = <provided in environment>

# Sets the level of detail of messages sent to the log file, if
# a log file location has been provided. Possible values, in
# increasing order of detail, are: "critical", "error", "warning",
# "info" and "debug". When reporting any agent issues to New
# Relic technical support, the most useful setting for the
# support engineers is "debug". However, this can generate a lot
# of information very quickly, so it is best not to keep the
# agent at this level for longer than it takes to reproduce the
# problem you are experiencing.
log_level = info

# High Security Mode enforces certain security settings, and prevents
# them from being overridden, so that no sensitive data is sent to New
# Relic. Enabling High Security Mode means that request parameters are
# not collected and SQL can not be sent to New Relic in its raw form.
# To activate High Security Mode, it must be set to 'true' in this
# local .ini configuration file AND be set to 'true' in the
# server-side configuration in the New Relic user interface. For
# details, see
# https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/subscriptions/high-security

# The Python Agent will attempt to connect directly to the New
# Relic service. If there is an intermediate firewall between
# your host and the New Relic service that requires you to use a
# HTTP proxy, then you should set both the "proxy_host" and
# "proxy_port" settings to the required values for the HTTP
# proxy. The "proxy_user" and "proxy_pass" settings should
# additionally be set if proxy authentication is implemented by
# the HTTP proxy. The "proxy_scheme" setting dictates what
# protocol scheme is used in talking to the HTTP proxy. This
# would normally always be set as "http" which will result in the
# agent then using a SSL tunnel through the HTTP proxy for end to
# end encryption.

# setting. For details about attributes configuration, please
# consult the documentation.
