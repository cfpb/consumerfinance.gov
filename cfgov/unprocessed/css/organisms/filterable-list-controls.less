.o-filterable-list-controls {
  // The filterable list controls is an expandable, which uses a max-height
  // transition that has the properties overflow:hidden and contain:paint set.
  // This means nothing outside of the expandable bounds will be painted,
  // which is good for performance, but is bad for things like drop-down menus
  // that overflow the expandable bounds.
  //
  // The solution below makes the multiselect drop-down not "float", like it
  // normally does, so that it expands to occupy space in the filterable list
  // controls expandable, and therefore will not float outside of the controls'
  // bounds.
  // TODO: While this fixes the multiselect drop-down being cropped, it does
  //       change the UX. A method to support overflowing the expandable bounds
  //       while still retaining performance optimizations should be explored.
