    <h2><strong>Your estimated debt: <span data-financial-item="debt_tenYearTotal"></strong></h2>

    <p>Based on the cost of attending the school and the amount of money you and your family can put towards school.</p>

    <h2><strong>Is this too much to repay?</strong></h2>

    <p><strong>A common guideline:</strong> Keep your student loan total below your first-year salary out of school. If your debt will be higher than your salary, consider whether it might be more debt than you can afford.</p>
