    <h1>Your estimated debt at graduation</h1>
    <p>This estimate is based on the most recent data from the U.S. Department of Education.</p>

    <h2><span data-school-item="school"></span>'s costs: <span data-financial-item="total_costs"></h2>

    <h2>Your estimated debt: <span data-financial-item="debt_totalAtGrad"></h2>

    <p><strong>A common guideline:</strong> Keep your student loan total below your first-year salary out of school. If your debt will be higher than your salary, consider whether it might be more debt than you can afford.</p>
