    <h2>How do I know if this is too much debt for me?</h2>
    <p>A simple guideline: If you’re borrowing more than you’ll earn in your first year after finishing your program, then you might be taking on more debt than you can afford. This page compares the median salary of this school’s recent students to your projected total debt at the end of your program. </p>
