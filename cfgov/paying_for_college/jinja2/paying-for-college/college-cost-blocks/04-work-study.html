    <h2>Work-study</h2>
    <p>Work-study programs are part-time jobs on campus. If your offer includes work-study, that means you are eligible to apply for work-study jobs&mdash;a job will not be lined up for you. The work-study amount in your offer is the maximum you can earn. It is estimated and <strong>not guaranteed.</strong></p>
