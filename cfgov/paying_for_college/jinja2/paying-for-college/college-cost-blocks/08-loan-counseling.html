    <h2>Using student loans strategically</h2>
    <p> Next you will make a plan to cover remaining costs. Since you will probably use loans to pay for school—most students do—it’s important to understand how they work. This page will overview how student loans work and their potential benefits and risks.</p> 

    <p>Student loans are money for education that you pay back with interest. That means you'll pay more than you originally borrowed.</p> 
    <p>For example, if you borrow $10,000 in unsubsidized loans with 4% annual interest, you will accrue $400 in interest each year before you enter repayment. So if you borrow that $10,000 in September 2020, graduate in May 2024, and enter repayment 6 months later (November 2024), you will accrue about $1,700 in interest and owe a total of $11,700 at that time. (If it’s a subsidized loans, you will owe just the original $10,000 when you enter repayment&mdash;and then start accruing interest as you gradually pay down the debt.)</p> 
    <p>To save money on the cost of student loans, you have four strategies:</p> 
    
    <ul>
        <li><strong>borrow less</strong></li>
        <li>shop around for <strong>lower interest rates</strong> on non-federal student loans (this will take research and additional loan applications)</li>
        <li><strong>pay down interest</strong> on unsubsidized debt while you're in school to avoid <em>capitalization</em>&mdash;paying interest on interest)</li>
        <li> repay your loans faster by making <strong>bigger monthly payments</strong> (depending on your federal loan repayment plan).</li> 
    </ul>
    
    <p>As this graph shows, someone with about $30,000 in student loans (typical for college undergraduates) will save more than $10,000 in interest by repaying their loan in 10 years instead of 25 years.</p>

    <p>So why take out student loans? A degree can open up more career options and increase your future earnings. Successfully repaying your student loans can help build your credit history. If higher education helps you reach your goals, the cost of student loans may be a good investment in your future—if you can afford to repay them.</p>

    <p>But be aware of the tradeoffs you’ll face when you leave school and enter repayment:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>You will owe monthly payments for many years.</strong> The average repayment period for the typical amount of debt is 20 years. These payments will take up money in your budget that you won’t be able to spend on other things, like saving for emergencies, retirement, or large purchases likes homes and cars.</li>
        <li><strong>Missing payments can keep you from other goals.</strong> If you can’t afford your payments and miss a payment deadline, your credit score might go down. Lower credit scores can make credit cards, home mortgages, and auto loans harder to get approved for and more expensive due to higher interest rates. </li>
        <li><strong>Repaying student loans is the only way you’re guaranteed to get rid of them.</strong> While loan forgiveness programs do exist for federal loans, they’re not guaranteed. Additionally, it is very difficult to get student loans discharged in bankruptcy and you should not rely on that option.</li>
    </ul>
