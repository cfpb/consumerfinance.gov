    <h2><strong>Estimated amount you could owe at graduation: <span data-financial-item="debt_totalAtGrad"></strong></h2>

    <p>Based on the cost of attending the school and the amount of money you and your family can put towards school, you'll likely need to take out student loans. School costs can change, so we've provided you a range of the amount you might need to borrow.</p>

    <h2><strong>Is this too much to repay?</strong></h2>

    <p>One way to see if this is too much to repay is to compare the amount you'll owe at graduation to the median salary of recent graduates.</p>

    <p>If you need to borrow more than the median salary, consider whether this plan is right for you.</p>

    <p>Your actual salary will depdend on factors like your field of work and where you live. <a href="https://www.bls.gov/bls/blswage.htm" target="_blank" class="external-link" rel="noreferrer noopener">Visit the BLS Wage Data site for more information.</a></p>

    <h2><strong>Estimated monthly payment: <span data-financial-item="debt_tenYearMonthly"></span></strong></h2>

    <p>Your payment estimate is based on making payments over 10 years on the standard repayment plan. Other plans may be available with lower monthly payments, but the total cost of borrowing will be higher.</p>
