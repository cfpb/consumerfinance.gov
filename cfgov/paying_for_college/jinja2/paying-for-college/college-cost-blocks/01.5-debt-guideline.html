    <p>The cost of student loans may be a good investment in your future&mdash;if you can afford to repay them.</p>

    <h3><strong>Check if the amount you'll owe is more than your estimated salary</strong></h3>

    <p><strong>A common guideline:</strong> Keep your student loan total below your first-year salary out of school. If your debt will be higher than your salary, consider whether it might be more debt than you can afford.</p>
