            <p>It’s first on this list, but you should do it whenever you’re confused or unsure of what to do next. They want to help you (and it’s their job)! You will not jeopardize your funding by asking too many questions.</p>

            <p>If you have uncovered upfront costs, talk to the financial aid office about options to reduce the amount due at the beginning of the school year, like tuition installment plans. Or can you (or your family) start saving for these now? </p>

        <div class="block block__sub">

            <h4>Ask about getting credits from a more affordable school.</h4>
            <p>Reach out to your academic advisor about taking core requirements at community college. (But be strategic about when you take them – if you start school with enough credits to count as a second- or third-year student, you may be disqualified from grants and scholarships for first-year students.)</p>
