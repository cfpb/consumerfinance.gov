        <h3>How to put this plan into action</h3>
        <h4>1. Ask the financial aid office any questions you still have.</h4>

        <p>It’s first on this list, but you should do it whenever you’re confused or unsure of what to do next. They want to help you (and it’s their job)! You will not jeopardize your funding by asking too many questions.</p>

        <h4>2. Find out what it takes to enroll.</h4>

        <p>How much is the deposit? What paperwork do you need to send in? When are the money and paperwork due?</p>

        <h4>3. Research the details of your grants and scholarships.</h4>

        <p>Read or ask about the requirements of each grant and scholarship. Ask if they are they renewable for following years—if not, you’ll need to find replacement funding next year. </p>

        <h4>4. Make a budget.</h4>

        <p>Use this cashflow budget to plan out when you’ll get money and when you’ll have to pay it.</p> 

        <h4>5. Double check that you’ll have enough money when you need it.</h4>

        <p>If you have uncovered direct costs, talk to the financial aid office about options to reduce the amount due at the beginning of the school year, like tuition installment plans. Or can you (or your family) start saving for these now? </p> 

        <h4>6. Accept the loans you want.</h4>

        <p> More paperwork ahead! You’ll also need to do entrance counseling for federal loans. Remember, you don’t need to accept all the loans you’re offered or the full amount.</p>

        <h4>7. Put a reminder in your calendar to fill out FAFSA on October 1.</h4>

        <p>If you’ll be in school next year, you’ll need to start this process again in a few months. </p>

        <h4>8. Set another reminder to visit the financial aid office every semester.</h4>

        <p>Ask about new opportunities for funding. For example, some scholarships are only open to certain majors or only for upperclassmen.</p>

        <h4>9. Know how many credits you already have and make a plan to graduate on time. </h4>

        <p> Make sure you get credit for your AP, IB, dual-enrollment, and transfer courses. Work with an academic adviser to stay on track for on-time graduation.</p>

        <h4>10. Ask about getting credits from a more affordable school.</h4>

        <p>Reach out to your academic advisor about taking core requirements at community college. Make sure they will count towards your degree. (And be strategic about when you take them – if you start school with enough credits to count as a second- or third-year student, you may be disqualified from grants and scholarships for first-year students.)</p>


        <h4>11. If you need them, apply for additional loans.</h4>

        <p>To get the best deal for your situation, read the fine print and shop around for the lowest interest rates and fees. You’ll probably need a cosigner for private loans.</p>

        <h3>Consider other options</h3>

        <h4>1. Ask about getting credits from a more affordable school.</h4>
        <p>Reach out to your academic advisor about options like taking core requirements at community college.</p>

        <h4>2. Reduce your living costs.</h4>
        <p>Can you live at home? Stick to public transit?</p> 

        <h4>3. Look for more grants and scholarships.</h4>
        <p>There are always more available, even if school starts in a week or two! Scholarship Finder is one place to look.</p>

        <h4>4. Consider working, if you weren’t going to.</h4>
        <p> While working can reduce borrowing and provide enriching experiences, remember that over 20 hours a week is associated with lower grades.</p>

        <h4>5. Think about other programs at this school.</h4>
        <p> You might want to consider choosing a major that will open the door to more lucrative career fields.</p>

        <h4>6. Explore other schools.</h4>
        <p>Even if this is the only school you applied to, it’s not your only option. For example, if you are pursuing a bachelor’s degree, you can start at community college this year and plan to apply for a transfer next year.</p>
