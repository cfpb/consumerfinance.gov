    <h2>Federal Loans</h2>
    <p> Any student loan must be repaid, with interest. Federal loans include some borrower protections and repayment options that are not typically offered by private and other non-federal loans.</p>

    <p>Undergraduates have access to two types of federal loans, <strong>Direct Subsidized</strong> and <strong>Direct Unsubsidized</strong>. For both, there are limits on how much you can borrow, and you will start repayment 6 months after you leave school or drop below half-time enrollment. Subsidized loans are cheaper than unsubsidized loans because the government pays the accruing interest until you enter repayment. You must demonstrate financial need on your FAFSA to qualify for subsidized loans, but anyone can take out unsubsidized loans. </p>

            <li> As the Department of Education explains, “Just because a school participates in the federal student aid programs doesn’t mean the federal government has endorsed the quality of education the school offers. To find out whether there have been any complaints about the school, contact your local Better Business Bureau®, state higher education agency, or the consumer protection division of your state attorney general’s office. Check with the agency that licenses or accredits the school to see whether it meets required standards.”</li>
            <li>You have to pay back your loans even if you don’t graduate.</li>
            <li> It is very difficult to get student loans discharged in bankruptcy and you should not rely on that option.</li>
