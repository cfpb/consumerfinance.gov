                                They are the most common type of student loan.

                                are different, start by selecting the loan type that you are most concerned about. You can always return to the beginning

                                If you have gone more than 9 months (270 days) without making a payment on your federal student loans, you may be in default.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Many private student loans go into default as soon as you are 120 days late. In some cases, a borrower may default by missing just one or two payments. You can also default on a private student loan if you declare bankruptcy or default on another loan. Review your private loan contracts carefully to better understand what rights you have if you are worried about going into default.

                <h3>Direct debit and extra payments</h3>

                <p>You're well on your way as long as you keep up with your loan payments.</p>

                <h4>Helpful advice</h4>

                <ul>
                    <li>Consider contacting your loan servicer to set up direct debit. With direct debit, your servicer is paid automatically from your bank account each month so you're less likely to miss a payment.  You should still get a billing statement each month letting you know the amount that will be paid. The Direct Loan program and many private lenders offer an interest rate reduction for those who set up direct debit.  For example, the Direct Loan program provides a 0.25% rate reduction which could result in substantial savings over the life of the loan. Even if you set up direct debit, check your account periodically to make sure everything is being processed correctly. Be sure you have enough funds in your account.  If you don’t have enough to cover your payment,  your loan will become delinquent and you might face fees from your bank and your student loan servicer.</li>

                    <li>If your budget allows for it, and you have already set aside some funds for emergencies and funds to get any employer matching funds offered for 401K contributions, then you could consider making a payment on your student loan for more than what is required. You'll pay off your loan faster and pay less in interest if you choose to make extra payments toward principal. For most federal loans and private (non-federal) loans, you can make additional payments at any time without a penalty. If you are working towards Public Student Loan Forgiveness, making additional payments may not be in your best interest, since it reduces the amount forgiven and increases your total cost.</li>

                    <li>If you do pay more than the minimum payment, be sure to tell the loan servicers to apply these payments to your loan with the highest interest rate first. Generally speaking, this will be the best way to make a big dent in your debt.</li>

                </ul>

                <h3>FEDERAL STUDENT LOAN CONSOLIDATION</h3>
                <p>Consolidation may be a good option if you want to simplify your repayment process.  A <b>Federal Direct Consolidation Loan</b> can replace multiple federal student loans with one new loan featuring a single monthly payment. However, it won't lower your interest rate.</p>

                <h4>Helpful advice</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>For federal student loan borrowers with multiple, older student loans from different lenders, consolidation offers added benefits, including eligibility for <a href="http://studentaid.ed.gov/repay-loans/forgiveness-cancellation/charts/public-service">Public Service Loan Forgiveness</a>.</li>
                    <li>Be mindful that if you consolidate your loan, any PSLF qualifying payments you have previously made will no longer be counted towards the 120 qualifying payments required for forgiveness.  Consolidating your loan may also make you ineligible for certain benefits like Perkins loan cancellation.  Consult with your servicer on whether consolidation is the best choice for you.</li>
                    <li>If you have a lot of student debt, you may be able to extend your payments over a longer period of time. For borrowers with $60,000 or more in student loan debt, this can be as long as 30 years. Although this will lower your monthly payments, it will cost you thousands of extra dollars over the lifetime of your loan, because you will owe and pay interest for a longer time. For many borrowers, borrowers, <a href="http://www.consumerfinance.gov/askcfpb/633/what-income-based-repayment-ibr.html">Income-Driven Repayment (IBR)</a> may be a cheaper alternative than consolidation.</li>
                    <li>If you took out a federal student loan before 2006 and have a variable interest rate, consolidating your loans will "lock in" your current interest rate—a great opportunity for borrowers when market rates are low or are expected to rise significantly.</li>
                    <li>Be aware, your interest rate will be recalculated as the weighted average of your current federal loans and rounded up to the nearest eighth of a percent. This means that your interest rate will not decrease and actually may rise slightly when you use a federal direct consolidation loan.</li>
                </ul>

                <p class='tip'><b>WARNING FOR SERVICEMEMBERS:</b> Taking out a new Federal Direct Consolidation Loan any time after entering active duty military service will impact your eligibility for an interest rate reduction under the <a href='http://www.consumerfinance.gov/askcfpb/675/i-am-member-military-active-duty-or-about-go-active-duty-what-options-exist-help-me-deal-my-student-loans.html'>Servicemembers Civil Relief Act</a>.</p>

                <p>To get started on federal direct loan consolidation, contact the Department of Education (1-800-557-7392) to find out if consolidation is right for you. To begin the application process, check out the Department’s consolidation <a href="http://loanconsolidation.ed.gov/">website</a>. You can also use the Department's <a href='http://studentaid.ed.gov/repay-loans/understand/plans/standard/comparison-calculator'>calculator</a> to determine your payments if you choose to extend your loan term and lower monthly payments.</p>

                <h3>Lower your interest rate</h3>

                <p>If you are currently serving on active-duty you are eligible to have the interest rate lowered to 6% on all student loans taken out prior to your military service. This benefit applies to both your federal and private (non-federal) student loans and is available for all active-duty servicemembers, regardless of where you serve. Most borrowers on active-duty will qualify for this benefit.</p>

                <p>To obtain an interest rate reduction under the <a href='http://www.consumerfinance.gov/askcfpb/675/i-am-member-military-active-duty-or-about-go-active-duty-what-options-exist-help-me-deal-my-student-loans.html'>Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (SCRA)</a>, contact your servicer and ask about this option directly. You will be required to notify your servicer in writing and provide your servicer with proof of your active-duty status in the form of orders from your commanding officer.</p>

                <p><a href="http://www.studentaid.ed.gov/types/grants-scholarships/military#limited-interest-rates-suspended-accrual-of-interest-and-deferment-of-student-loans">Learn more about the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act</a> and other benefits for servicemembers with student loans from the U.S. Department of Education.</p>

                <p>You may also be eligible for other benefits available to servicemembers, such as military deferment, as well as other generally available repayment options such as  Income-Driven Repayment</p>

                <h3>Income-driven repayment plans and Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF)</h3>

                <p>This is one of the best options to stay on the road to repayment for federal student loan borrowers whose student loan debt is high relative to their income. <a href='http://blog.ed.gov/2015/12/your-federal-student-loans-just-got-easier-to-repaye/'>Income-driven repayment plans</a> tie your payment to your income and family size.</p>

                <p class='illus paperwork'>For borrowers who will make a career out of military service, income-driven repayment plans provide another major benefit— you may be eligible for <a href="http://studentaid.ed.gov/repay-loans/forgiveness-cancellation/charts/public-service">loan forgiveness</a> after 10 years of reduced monthly payments. If you think you will spend a decade or more in the military, it is important to see if you qualify for reduced monthly payment under an income-driven repayment plan as soon as possible. If you do qualify and enroll, each qualifying monthly payment gets you closer to <a href="http://studentaid.ed.gov/repay-loans/forgiveness-cancellation/charts/public-service">Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF)</a>.</p>

                    <p>If you leave the military but plan to pursue another qualifying public service profession, like teaching or serving in government, you may still be eligible for PSLF. To have your military service count toward the ten year public service requirement, see if you qualify for reduced monthly payment under an income-driven repayment plan early in your military service.</p>

                    <div class='act'>
                        <p>Get started with income-driven repayment as soon as possible by <a href="https://studentloans.gov/myDirectLoan/index.action" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">enrolling online at StudentLoans.gov</a>. Once you sign in, select “Income-Driven Repayment Plan Request.” These plans are always available for free to federal student loan borrowers.</p>

                        <p>You can also contact your loan servicer (the company that sends you a bill each month) about enrolling. Whether you apply online or contact your servicer, you will be asked to document your income to determine your payment.  You can document your income using a secure link to the IRS or by providing the servicer with a copy of a recent tax return or pay stub.</p>

                        <p>Federal loan programs and their service providers NEVER charge any fees to borrowers who switch to another repayment plan, including any of the income-driven payment options. If you have an older federal loan made by a private lender, you may need to consolidate your loans in order to enroll in an income-driven repayment plan that may offer the lowest monthly payment. Learn more about how this works here. Learn more about <a href="http://blog.ed.gov/2015/12/your-federal-student-loans-just-got-easier-to-repaye/">how this works here</a>.</p>

                        <p>For federal loans, consider income-driven repayment plans before options that postpone payment such as deferment or forbearance. While completely postponing payment may sound like an attractive option, if you enroll in income-driven plans and recertify each year, you can keep your payments low and, if you have ten years of public service and make qualifying payments, you can apply to have your remaining balance forgiven.</p>

                    <h3>Military Deferment</h3>

                    <p>You are eligible to have federal loans deferred for a certain period of time if you are an active-duty member of the military serving in a military operation or national emergency.</p>

                        <p>Remember, military deferment doesn't make your loans go away—and can mean that you will owe a lot more once you reenter repayment because your interest will continue to accrue depending on your loan type.</p>
                    </div>

                    <p class='act'>To get a deferment, contact your servicer and ask about this option directly. Once you're in deferment, you can still make a payment if you get some extra cash.</p>

                    <p>Remember, you might also have other options. The best way to learn about all of them is to contact your servicer.</p>

                    <h3>Federal direct consolidation loans</h3>

                    <p>If you are currently in default on a federal student loan and plan to go back to school, you may benefit from a direct consolidation loan.  If you cannot afford to pay off your loan in full, this is the fastest way to get out of default and restore your eligibility for federal student aid.</p>

                    <p>Through consolidation, your defaulted loans are paid off by a new loan with new repayment terms. If you do not make any payments on your defaulted loan(s) prior to consolidating them, you will be <span class="tooltip-info" tooltip="You can consolidate your loans without immediately signing up for an alternative repayment program, but you must first make three on-time monthly payments to the collector.  If you enroll in ICR or IBR, you skip the monthly payment requirement.">required to sign-up immediately for one of the alternative payment plans available to all federal student loan borrowers</span>.</p>

                    <p class='tip'>Ask your debt collector for specific information about fees. The costs associated with bringing your loan out of default may vary substantially depending on your individual circumstances.</p>

                    <p>Before you consolidate, make sure you understand the terms of this new payment arrangement and the terms of your new loan.  If you default again, your only option to get out of default is to agree to a repayment plan with your debt collector.</p>

                    <p class='tip'><a href="http://www.consumerfinance.gov/askcfpb/657/what-are-main-advantages-rehabilitation-option-when-dealing-collection-agency.html">Loan rehabilitation</a> may be a better option for some borrowers; however, rehabilitation can take up to 10 months to complete.  Like consolidation, loan rehabilitation restores your federal student aid eligibility but will also remove the default notation from your credit history. And in some cases, it can be cheaper than consolidation.</p>

                    <p class='act'>Under most circumstances, you have the right to pursue these options. Request information on both of these options from your debt collector or you may <a href="http://loanconsolidation.ed.gov/">apply for a new direct consolidation loan</a> with the U.S. Department of Education.</p>

                    <p>Contact your servicer or debt collection agency immediately to learn more about your options and to make arrangements to bring your loan out of default.  If a debt collector refuses to offer you an option for which you believe you qualify, ask to speak with the debt collector's Special Assistance Unit. If your issue has not been resolved through the servicer's Special Assistance Unit, you may wish to review your options through the <a href='https://studentaid.ed.gov/repay-loans/disputes/prepare'>Federal Student Aid Ombudsman Group</a> at the U.S. Department of Education.</p>

                    <p class='tip'>When speaking with your servicer or a debt collector, be sure that you have written documentation about what federal student debt you owe. If you are concerned that you never borrowed certain loans, check the <a href="http://www.nslds.ed.gov/">National Student Loan Data System</a>. If the loan does not appear there, contact the collector and inform the collector of the problem.  Remember, that system shows only your federal student loans, not your private student loans.</p>

                    <h3>Rehabilitation</h3>

                    <p>If you are currently in default on a federal student loan and you are interested in pursuing an option that offers the lowest monthly payment or the greatest opportunity to protect your credit record, you may wish to look into <b>rehabilitation</b>.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Rehabilitation means that your loan will be taken out of default status after you make a series of monthly payments. Generally, you have to make nine consecutive on-time monthly payments.</li>
                        <li>With rehabilitation, your loan payments are based on how much money you make. Your payments can be as low as $5 per month if you are unemployed or have very little income. Your servicer or debt collector is required by law to offer you this income-driven rehabilitation payment plan.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>If a debt collector refuses to offer you an option for which you believe you qualify, <a href="http://www.consumerfinance.gov/complaint/#debt-collection">submit a complaint online</a> or by calling (855) 411-2372.</p>

                    <p>Rehabilitation won't repair your credit completely—your previous missed payments may still show up on your credit report—but any default notation will be removed. Your servicer or debt collector may ask you to provide documentation to demonstrate that you need a lower payment than they are suggesting. When working with your debt collector, the law requires your collector to determine your payment amount based on your income.  Once you agree to a payment plan, you are required to make your monthly payment in order to rehabilitate your defaulted loan. If you miss that reduced payment, your loan can be taken out of rehabilitation.</p>

                    <p class='act'>Contact your servicer or debt collector immediately to learn more about your options and to make arrangements to bring your loan out of default.</p>

                    <h3>Know Your Options</h3>

                    <p>Generally speaking, you have three options when dealing with the collector on a federal student loan:</p>

                    <ol>
                        <li><b><a href='#Module-5:-Default-rehabilitation-'>Rehabilitation</a></b>: Rehabilitation means that your loan will be taken out of default status after you make a series of consecutive (generally, nine) on-time "reasonable and affordable" payments. You can typically only rehabilitate a loan once.  This is the only way to remove the default notation from your credit history.  If you chose to go back to school, you will also restore your eligibility for federal student aid after you make the sixth of nine monthly payments.</li>

                        <li><b><a href='#Module-4:-Default-back-to-school-consolidation-'>Consolidation</a></b>: Through consolidation, your defaulted loans are paid off by a new loan with new repayment terms.  If you cannot afford to repay your loan in full, this is the fastest way to get out of default and enroll in one of the U.S. Department of Education's alternative payment plans.  If you cannot afford to pay off your loan in full, it is also the fastest way to get out of default and restore your eligibility for federal student aid. Borrowers should also be aware that consolidation will not undo the negative effect on your credit report caused by your default.</li>

                        <li><b><a href='#Module-6:-Default-repayment-'>Repayment</a></b>: If you can afford to pay off your defaulted federal loan, this is the fastest way to settle your debt.  Under certain circumstances, your debt collector may be authorized to waive some of your outstanding fees and other collection costs.  For some borrowers, this can be the cheapest way to bring a federal student loan out of default.  Your defaulted debt will be gone afterward, but it will continue to appear on your credit report as a defaulted loan that was repaid.  You will also restore your eligibility for federal student aid, if you chose to go back to school.</li>

                    <p>Through consolidation, your defaulted loans are paid off by a new loan with new repayment terms. If you do not make any payments on your defaulted loan(s) prior to consolidating them, you will be required to immediately sign-up for one of the alternative payment plans available to all federal student loan borrowers.  You will also restore your eligibility for federal student aid, if you choose to go back to school. Before you consolidate, make sure you understand the terms of this new payment arrangement and the terms of your new loan.  If you default again, your only option to get out of default is to agree to a repayment plan with your debt collector.</p>

                    <p class='tip'><a href="http://www.consumerfinance.gov/askcfpb/657/what-are-main-advantages-rehabilitation-option-when-dealing-collection-agency.html">Loan rehabilitation</a> may be a better option for some borrowers; however, rehabilitation can take up to 10 months to complete.  Like consolidation, loan rehabilitation restores your federal student aid eligibility but will also remove the default notation from your credit history.  And in some cases, it can be cheaper than consolidation.</p>

                    <p class='act'>Contact your servicer or debt collection agency immediately to learn more about your options and to make arrangements to bring your loan out of default.</p>

                    <p>If a debt collector refuses to offer you an option for which you believe you qualify, ask to speak with the debt collector's Special Assistance Unit. If your issue has not been resolved through the servicer's Special Assistance Unit, you may wish to review your options through the <a href='https://studentaid.ed.gov/repay-loans/disputes/prepare'>Federal Student Aid Ombudsman Group</a> at the U.S. Department of Education.</p>

                    <p class='tip'>When speaking with your servicer or a debt collector, be sure that you have written documentation about what federal student debt you owe. If you are concerned that you never borrowed certain loans, check the <a href="https://nslds.ed.gov/nslds/nslds_SA/">National Student Loan Data System</a>. If the loan does not appear there, contact the collector and inform the collector of the problem.  Remember, that system shows only your federal student loans, not your private student loans.</p>

                                    <p>If you enroll in auto-debit, your servicer (the company that sends you a bill each month) will automatically withdraw money from your bank account so you’re less likely to miss a payment. Many servicers and lenders offer an interest rate reduction for those who set up auto-debit, which could save you hundreds or thousands of dollars over the life of the loan!</p>

                                    <p>By releasing your co-signer, you will be removing your co-signer from their obligation to repay your loan. Releasing your co-signer can protect you from surprise defaults, even if you’ve been making your payment on time. Many lenders advertise that a co-signer may be released from a private student loan after a certain number of consecutive, timely payments and a credit check to determine if you are eligible to repay the loan on your own. </p>

                    <h3>Lower your interest rate</h3>

                    <p>If you are currently serving on active duty, you are eligible to have the interest rate lowered to 6% on all student loans taken out prior to your military service. This benefit applies to both your federal and private (non-federal) student loans and is available for all active-duty servicemembers, regardless of where you serve.  Most borrowers on active duty will qualify for this benefit, so it makes sense to start here.</p>

                    <p class='act'>To obtain an interest rate reduction under the <a href='http://www.consumerfinance.gov/askcfpb/675/i-am-member-military-active-duty-or-about-go-active-duty-what-options-exist-help-me-deal-my-student-loans.html'>Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (SCRA)</a>, contact your servicer and ask about this option directly. You will be required to provide your servicer with proof of your active duty status in the form of orders from your commanding officer.</p>

                    <p><a href="http://www.studentaid.ed.gov/types/grants-scholarships/military#limited-interest-rates-suspended-accrual-of-interest-and-deferment-of-student-loans">Learn more about the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act</a> and other benefits for servicemembers with student loans from the U.S. Department of Education.</p>

                    <p>You may also be eligible for other benefits available to servicemembers, such as military deferment and <a href="http://www.consumerfinance.gov/askcfpb/633/what-income-based-repayment-ibr.html">Income-Driven Repayment (IBR) for federal student loans</a>.</p>

                    <h3>Military deferment/forbearance</h3>

                    <p>Some private student loan servicers offer deferment or forbearance for servicemembers on active duty.  This may provide temporary relief, but it does not eliminate your obligation to repay your loans.</p>

                    <p class='illus defer'>Unlike some federal student loans, for most private student loans, interest will still accrue during periods of deferment and forbearance.  If you do work with your servicer to temporarily suspend your monthly payments, your total debt will continue to grow and your monthly payments may be much higher when you begin to repay.</p>

                    <p class='act'>To get a military deferment or forbearance, contact your servicer and ask about this option directly. Once you're in deferment, you can still make a payment if you get some extra cash.  If you can afford it, making interest-only payments is a good idea.  It will stop your student debt from growing.</p>

                    <p>Remember, you might also have other options. The best way to learn about all of them is to contact your servicer.</p>

                            <h2>Reach out to your loan servicer</h2>

                            <p>You may have options to lower your monthly payment. Many companies say that they have alternate payment programs for borrowers who might not be able to make a full payment. These plans may include:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>graduated repayment</strong>&mdash;a plan where your payments start out lower and gradually increase over time.</li>
                                <li><strong>extended repayment</strong>&mdash;a plan where you pay less each month but extend the life of your loan over a longer period of time.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>Asking for help when you run into trouble can keep you from falling further behind. Contact your student loan servicer and ask what options are available to you.  Your student loan servicer is the company that sends you a bill each month.</p>

                                            <li><strong>Consider downloading our</strong> <a href="http://www.consumerfinance.gov/f/201410_cfpb_students_sample-financial-worksheet.doc" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sample financial worksheet</a> to help you determine the maximum amount of money you can put toward student loans.</li>

                                            <li><strong>Be wary of options that postpone your monthly payment.</strong> When you put off making payments by signing up for <a href="/askcfpb/631/what-forbearance.html" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">forbearance</a> or <a href="/askcfpb/629/what-deferment.html" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">deferment</a>, interest will still continue to accrue. This means that once you begin to pay back your loan again, you’ll discover that your student loan balance has grown (you will owe more money than before). You should also watch out for fees when enrolling in forbearance programs.</li>

                                            <li><strong>Consider using these sample instructions.</strong> You can use the sample letter text below in a letter, email, or message sent via the “Send a Message” or “Contact Us” feature when you log into your account on the servicer’s website. These instructions may help you get valuable information on repayment options to reduce your monthly payment or to temporarily postpone making payments. </li>

                            <p class="subtitle">Dealing with a defaulted loan and debt collectors can be stressful.  If you are in default on a private (non-federal) loan, it is important that you know your rights and responsibilities. While it is your responsibility to pay what is owed, remember that you have rights when dealing with debt collectors, and it is against the law for a collector to abuse, harass, or make false statements to you.</p>

                            <p class="highlighted five-days">Unless provided in the initial contact, within five (5) days, every debt collector must send a written “validation notice” indicating how much money you owe, the name of the creditor you owe, what dispute rights you have if you think you do not owe this debt, and how to obtain information about the original creditor. Keep this notice and use it as a reference when speaking with a debt collector.</p>

                            <p>You may receive a notice that your entire student loan must be paid off immediately and in full, however you may be able to negotiate or set up a payment plan. You may also have the opportunity to negotiate with the collector to settle your debt for less than you currently owe. Below are some key points to keep in mind and some sample instructions you can use when communicating with collectors and creditors.</p>

                            <h3 class="m12_h3">Key differences between private and federal student loan debt</h3>

                            <p class="subtitle">For borrowers in default, it is important to remember that there are major differences between federal and private student loans.</p>

                            <p>A debt collector seeking to recover a private student loan does not work for, represent, or collect on behalf of the U.S. Department of Education or any other branch of the federal government. A debt collector trying to collect payments on a private student loan generally may not:</p>

                                <li>Garnish your wages without a court order;</li>
                                <li>Intercept your federal or state tax refund;</li>
                                <li>Garnish your Social Security or Social Security disability payments; or</li>
                                <li>Prevent you from receiving federal student aid to go back to school in the future.</li>

                                <p>The first step to moving forward and getting out of default is clearly communicating with debt collectors. We’ve created five action letters that you can consider using in order to get valuable information about claims being made against you or protect yourself from inappropriate or unwanted collection activities.</p>

                                        <p>IIf you fail to repay a private student loan in default, it can severely damage your credit record and your credit score, making it difficult or more expensive to take out a mortgage, buy a car or even get a credit card. You may be subject to collection efforts by a debt collector or a law firm. You might even be sued by a debt collector and face a court order to garnish part of your wages—this means that money will be taken directly from your paycheck in order to satisfy your debt. And, unlike most other types of consumer debt, student loans cannot be discharged through bankruptcy, absent extraordinary circumstances (called “undue hardship”).</p>

                    <h3>Lower your interest rate</h3>

                    <p>If you are currently serving on active duty you are eligible to have the interest rate lowered to 6% on all student loans taken out prior to your military service. This benefit applies to both your federal and private (non-federal) student loans and is available for all active-duty servicemembers, regardless of where you serve.  Most borrowers on active duty will qualify for this benefit, so it makes sense to start here.</p>

                    <p class='act'>To obtain an interest rate reduction under the <a href='http://www.consumerfinance.gov/askcfpb/675/i-am-member-military-active-duty-or-about-go-active-duty-what-options-exist-help-me-deal-my-student-loans.html'>Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (SCRA)</a>, contact your servicer and ask about this option directly. You will be required to provide your servicer with proof of your active duty status in the form of orders from your commanding officer.</p>

                    <p><a href="http://www.studentaid.ed.gov/types/grants-scholarships/military#limited-interest-rates-suspended-accrual-of-interest-and-deferment-of-student-loans">Learn more about the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act</a> and other benefits for servicemembers with student loans from the U.S. Department of Education.</p>

                    <p>You may also be eligible for other benefits available to servicemembers, such as military deferment and <a href="http://www.consumerfinance.gov/askcfpb/633/what-income-based-repayment-ibr.html">Income-Driven Repayment (IBR) for federal student loans</a>.</p>

                    <h3>Contact your servicer</h3>

                    <p class='act'>Call your private (non-federal) loan servicer and ask what options are available to you. Most of the big lenders say that they have alternate payment programs for borrowers who might not be able to make a full payment.  You can often find out about these options on your servicer's website.</p>

                    <h4>Helpful advice</h4>


                    <p>If you can afford to make partial payments, you may want to ask about <b>graduated repayment</b> or <b>extended repayment</b>.  Not all private (non-federal) loan servicers offer these programs, but some do.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Graduated repayment</b> has low payments in the early years that increase over time.  This option can be good for those who are comfortable with their payments changing over time.</li>
                        <li><b>Extended repayment</b> increases the time you will take to pay off the loan, so each individual payment is smaller.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Remember, both of these programs increase the total amount you pay in interest over the life of the loan, often substantially.</p>

                    <p>If you can't afford to pay at all, some of the most popular programs for temporarily stopping your payments are <b>deferment</b> and <b>forbearance</b>.  Unlike federal student loans, your private (non-federal) loans don't have a common set of consumer protections when it comes to <b>deferment</b> and <b>forbearance</b>.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Generally speaking, you may be able to get a <b>deferment</b> if you're heading back to school.  This will freeze payments on your loans (though interest might still be adding up).</li>
                        <li><b>Forbearance</b> will also pause your payments.  Again, interest might still add up.  <b>Watch out for fees when enrolling in forbearance programs.</b></li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Military deferment/forbearance</h3>

                    <p>Some private student loan servicers offer deferment or forbearance for servicemembers on active duty.  This may provide temporary relief, but it does not eliminate your obligation to repay your loans.</p>

                    <p>Unlike some federal student loans, for most private student loans, interest will still accrue during periods of deferment and forbearance.  If you do work with your servicer to temporarily suspend your monthly payments, your total debt will continue to grow and your monthly payments may be much higher when you begin to repay.</p>

                    <p class='act'>To get a military deferment or forbearance, contact your servicer and ask about this option directly. Once you're in deferment, you can still make a payment if you get some extra cash.  If you can afford it, making interest-only payments is a good idea.  It will stop your student debt from growing.</p>

                    <p>Remember, you might also have other options. The best way to learn about all of them is to contact your servicer.</p>
