                            If you're considering student loans to help you pay for school,
                            you're not alone - many students need loans to cover their full cost of attendance.
                            In 2010, 67% of bachelor's degree recipients used loans to pay for their education.
                            But the more money you borrow now,
                            the higher your monthly loan payments will be after you graduate.
                        </p>

                                    <p>If you have to take out student loans, you essentially have two choices: federal student
                                        loans and private loans.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>For most borrowers, federal student loans are the best option. When you start to pay back
                                        your federal loans, the interest rate will be fixed, which will help you predict your
                                        payments after graduation. And in some cases, the federal government will pay the
                                        interest on your loans while you are in school - these loans are called subsidized
                                        loans.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>Other student loans are generally private student loans. The most common private student
                                        loans are offered by banks. Their interest rates are often variable, which means your
                                        interest rates and payments could go up over time. Private loans can also be more
                                        expensive - rates have been as high as 16% over the past couple of years. And when it is
                                        time to repay, private loans don't offer as many options to reduce or postpone payments.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>For most people, federal student loans are a better deal than private student loans, so
                                        you'll want to take advantage of federal options first.</p>

                                        <li>Cut costs. Consider getting one or more roommates or a part-time job, possibly

                                        <li> See what your family can contribute. Your parents may be able to get tax credits
                                            for their contributions. Parents can also explore the federal Direct PLUS Loan
                                            program.</li>

                                        <li>Shop around for a private loan. Remember that these loans generally have higher
                                            interest rates and less repayment flexibility compared to federal student loans. You
                                            generally should turn to private loans only after you have explored all other grant,
                                            scholarship, and federal loan options. If you can show you have a very high credit
                                            rating, you may find an affordable private student loan, though you will likely need
                                            a co-signer, who will be legally obligated to repay the loan if you can't or don't.
                                            Look for the one with the lowest interest rate and flexible repayment options.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </div>

                                <div class='answer-entry' id="answer3">
                                    <p>First, make sure you need a private student loan. These loans generally are not as
                                        affordable as federal student loans and offer little repayment flexibility. </p>

                                    <p>Here are some factors to consider: </p>

                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Talk to your school's financial aid office to get a form certifying that you need
                                            additional aid to cover the cost of attendance - most lenders require it.</li>

                                        <li>Shop for lower interest rates and loans that offer flexibility if you have trouble
                                            making payments. </li>

                                        <li>Some private lenders may advertise very low interest rates - remember that only
                                            borrowers with the best credit will qualify for these rates. Your rate could be much
                                            higher. </li>
                                        <li>In 2011, over 90% of private student loans required a co-signer, so make sure you
                                            have someone like a parent or another relative lined up. Your co-signer will be
                                            legally obligated to repay the loan if you can't or don't. You may want to consider
                                            loans that offer "co-signer release" after a number of on-time payments. </li>
                                    </ul>
                                </div>

                                <li>Cut costs. Consider getting one or more roommates or a part-time job, possibly through <a
                                        class="exit-link" href="http://studentaid.ed.gov/types/work-study" target="_blank"

                                <li> See what your family can contribute. Your parents may be able to get tax credits for their
                                    contributions. Parents can also explore the federal Direct PLUS Loan program.</li>

                                <li>Shop around for a private loan. Remember that these loans generally have higher interest
                                    rates and less repayment flexibility compared to federal student loans. You generally should
                                    turn to private loans only after you have explored all other grant, scholarship, and federal
                                    loan options. If you can show you have a very high credit rating, you may find an affordable
                                    private student loan, though you will likely need a co-signer, who will be legally obligated
                                    to repay the loan if you can't or don't. Look for the one with the lowest interest rate and
                                    flexible repayment options.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <h2 class="font-xxl nc">What should I consider when shopping for a private loan?</h2>
                            <p>First, make sure you need a private student loan. These loans generally are not as affordable as
                                federal student loans and offer little repayment flexibility. </p>

                            <p>Here are some factors to consider: </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Talk to your school's financial aid office to get a form certifying that you need additional
                                    aid to cover the cost of attendance - most lenders require it.</li>

                                <li>Shop for lower interest rates and loans that offer flexibility if you have trouble making
                                    payments. </li>

                                <li>Some private lenders may advertise very low interest rates - remember that only borrowers
                                    with the best credit will qualify for these rates. Your rate could be much higher. </li>
                                <li>In 2011, over 90% of private student loans required a co-signer, so make sure you have
                                    someone like a parent or another relative lined up. Your co-signer will be legally obligated
                                    to repay the loan if you can't or don't. You may want to consider loans that offer
                                    "201cco-signer release" after a number of on-time payments. </li>

                            <p>Federal student loans almost always cost less and are easier to repay than private loans. You

                                eligible for federal student loans.</p>

                            <h4>Perkins Loans</h4>
                            <p>Subsidized with a fixed 5% interest rate, administered through your school, and awarded based on
                                financial need</p>

                            <p>If you are eligible, you should take this loan first</p>
                            <!--<a href='<br>{"hidden":true,"alt_view":"hidden"}'>More info</a>-->

                            <h4>Direct Loans</h4>
                            <p>Either subsidized or unsubsidized</p>

                            <p>Everyone is eligible for the Unsubsidized Direct Loan, and Subsidized Direct Loans are awarded
                                based on financial need</p>

                            <h4>Parent or Grad PLUS Loans</h4>
                            <p>Available to graduate students and parents</p>

                            <p>Parents with PLUS loans are responsible for repaying those loans</p>

                            <h3>Private Loan Options</h3>
                            <p>There are many different private loan options, with different interest rates and costs.
                                Generally, private student loans have higher costs than federal student loans and require a
                                co-signer.</p>

                            <p>Borrowing beyond your federal loans could mean high levels of debt. Make sure you have explored
                                all other options including applying for additional scholarships, cutting costs, or getting a
                                part-time job before taking out a private loan. If you are still deciding where to go to school,
                                consider all your options, including finding a low-cost school.</p>

                            <p>However if you need a private student loan, you should know that there are some unexpected places
                                to look for deals. It's important to shop around and compare different loan offers.</p>

                            <h4>State Agency Loans</h4>
                            <p>Loans offered by states to residents, or for students attending school in the state</p>
                            <p>Ask your school's financial aid office for more information about "state sponsored alternative
                                loans"</p>

                            <p>These loans come from commercial banks. You may be more familiar with their checking or savings
                                accounts</p>
                            <p>Talk to your parent or someone you trust about this option because you will likely need a

                                <p>Congress has the authority to change federal student loan rates, but once you agree to a
                                    federal student loan, your interest rate remains the same until you have paid it off.</p>

                                <p>Interest rates on private student loans are set by the lender that makes the loan and depend
                                    on the lender's evaluation of your creditworthiness. Some private loans have variable
                                    interest rates, which mean your payment amount could change over time.</p>

                                <p>Don't replace student loan debt with credit card debt - it can be a much more expensive way
                                    to finance your education. Credit cards do not provide the flexible repayment terms or
