                  What is a financial aid disbursement?

                <p>Your financial aid disbursement is the money left after your school takes out the cost of tuition,
                  fees, and any on-campus living expenses from your total financial aid award. You normally have several
                  options for how you get that money, including direct deposit to a bank account, to a card that might
                  also double as your student ID, by check, or cash.</p>

                <span class="btn-close">&times;</span>
                <p>When you spend more money than you have in your account, your bank will likely charge you an
                  overdraft fee. So a $4 cup of coffee can end up costing you $35 or more. You can be charged several
                  overdraft fees in a single day and even more in extended overdraft charges if your account remains
                  overdrawn for a few days, so be careful - these fees add up quickly.
                </p>
                <p>To avoid paying overdraft fees, monitor your accounts carefully and consider:</p>

                <ul>
                  <li>Not opting-in to services that pay for overdrafts connected to ATM or one-time debit card
                    withdrawals</li>
                  <li>Linking your account to a savings account - you may still pay a fee for transferring funds from
                    your savings account, but it is usually much lower than an overdraft fee</li>
                  <li>Choosing an account that does not allow overdrafts</li>
                </ul>
