                    <p>
                        If the school has adopted the &ldquo;Understanding Your
                        Financial Aid Offer&rdquo; tool, they will send you a
                        link to the tool. Click on the link and verify your
                        financial aid information, which is prepopulated in the
                        tool. Then complete the additional steps of the tool
                        before moving forward with the enrollment process.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The amounts in Step 1 have been prepopulated based on
                        your specific financial aid information, which has been
                        provided by the school.  Your financial aid information
                        should accurately reflect your aid offer from the
                        school. If the information is incorrect please reach out
                        to the school’s financial aid office and have them
                        generate a new link to our tool.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When you use this tool, you can change those financial
                        aid amounts to see how reducing loan amounts or
                        increasing personal contributions can affect your
                        overall debt. Please note that editing information in
                        this tool will not change your financial aid offer. If
                        you would like to discuss changes to your financial aid
                        offer, you must talk to the school’s financial aid
                        office.

                        starts after you leave school. However, interest may
                        start accruing before the 10-year repayment period

                        length. Thus, the graduation rate for a four-year
                        bachelor’s degree program includes students who
                        completed their degrees within six years of their
                        initial enrollment. If the school primarily awards

                        for undergraduates is that your &ldquo;debt when
                        repayment begins&rdquo; should not exceed your
                        anticipated annual salary the first year out of school.
                        This guideline, which is cited by some financial aid
                        commentators, is meant to serve as a guidepost to help
                        you determine if you may be borrowing too much.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        However, like any rule of thumb, it is a broad
                        generalization that doesn’t apply to every person or
                        every situation. You should consider all your options
                        before making a decision.

                    <p>
                        To determine your estimated monthly student loan
                        payment, we take your &ldquo;total at repayment&rdquo;
                        from Step 1 and calculate your payments (accounting for
                        accrued interest) over a standard 10-year repayment
                        period, which would be 120 months.

                        If you owe more than $30,000 in Federal Direct loans,
                        you are eligible to enroll in the extended repayment
                        plan, which can stretch the term of the loan from 10
                        years to 25 years.  Depending on the estimated amount of
                        your Federal Direct loans, the tool will give you the
                        option to &ldquo;toggle&rdquo; between a 10-year and
                        25-year repayment period. This feature will illustrate
                        how lengthening the term will lower the monthly payment
                        but increase total repayment costs.

                    <p>
                        One thing to consider before choosing a longer repayment
                        period is that the longer the repayment period is, the
                        more you pay in interest over the total life of the
                        loan.

                        Also, federal student loans have other repayment plan
                        options for repaying your federal student loans,
                        including Pay as You Earn (PAYE) and Income-Based
                        Repayment Plans (IBR), which are based on your income.
                        Your loan servicer will notify you of your repayment
                        options before your grace period ends.  Also, you have
                        the right to switch to another available repayment plan
                        at any time during the repayment of your loans. <a

                        The school provides an average percentage of students
                        who graduate from your program and get a job in their
                        field of study within six months of graduation (not
                        including a number of exceptions). This is known as a
                        job placement rate.  It is important to understand that
                        there is no standard formula for calculating a job
                        placement rate, which means that schools calculate the
                        job placement rate differently using different
                        assumptions.  You should ask the school for details on
                        how its job placement rate is calculated in order to
                        understand the assumptions underlying the job placement
                        rate calculation.

                        on student loan payments, also referred to as your

                        If you owe more than $30,000 in Federal Direct loans,

                        can stretch the term of the loan from 10 years to 25
                        years. If your anticipated, post-school Direct loan
                        balance exceeds $30,000, the tool will give you an

                        it will also significantly increase your total interest

                        payments when you have a lower salary. For instance, if

                        based repayment plans you may be paying off your loans

                    <p>
                        The loan default rate is the percentage of a school’s
                        borrowers who entered the repayment period on their
                        federal loans during the period beginning three years
                        ago on October 1 and who defaulted before September 30
                        of last year. Specifically, &ldquo;loan default
                        rate&rdquo; refers to the program’s three-year cohort
                        default rate as calculated according to 34 CFR

                        When a borrower fails to make scheduled payments on
                        student loans over a certain period of time, his or her
                        loans will be called into &ldquo;default&rdquo;. The
                        loan default rate shown in the tool is for students in
                        the program who started having to repay their student
                        loans during the period beginning three years ago on
                        October 1, but have gone into default sometime prior to
                        September 30 of the past year. For instance, if a
                        student graduated five years ago, has been making
                        payments on the loan, and then goes into default, that
                        default is not counted in the three-year default rate.

                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        After you answer the question between Steps 2 and Steps
                        3, we send a notification to the school telling them
                        you’ve completed the tool. Once the school has been
                        notified, you are able to move forward in the enrollment
                        process.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Keep in mind that we only notify the school when you
                        complete the tool; we do not share with them any of your
                        responses to our questions or edits you made to your aid
                        offer.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Remember that any changes you made to your offer in Step
                        1 do not affect your actual financial aid offer or your
                        ability to accept the original offer.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You will need to contact the school’s financial aid
                        representative and work with them to have your financial
                        aid package updated if you’d like to make changes to
                        your original financial aid offer.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Lastly, make sure you have promptly provided any
                        documents the school has requested, as the school may
                        need to receive those documents before you will be able
                        to receive any type of grant or loans.

                        In Step 3, we provide some ideas for either decreasing
                        the amount that you borrow or increasing your
                        post-graduation earnings. This list only contains a few
                        ideas for ways that you might better afford attending
                        school. More guidance on preparing for college is
