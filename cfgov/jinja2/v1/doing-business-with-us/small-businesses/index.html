            We offer information here to help small, women-owned, and minority-owned businesses particpate in the
            procurement and award process. We also publish information about existing awards to Small Business
            Administration-designated business classes. We are dedicated to working with small business
            owners—particularly women, minorities, and service-disabled veterans—and we welcome feedback about how
            we're doing.
