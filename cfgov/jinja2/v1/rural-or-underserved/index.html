                        <p>
                        This tool is maintained by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB or Bureau) to help creditors determine which properties are located in a “rural” or “underserved” area as defined in 12 CFR 1026.35(b)(2)(iv)(A) and (B).  A creditor may rely on this tool to provide a safe harbor determination that a property is located in a rural or underserved area.  However, the tool is not applicable to the exemption from the § 1026.35(c)(4) requirement for an additional appraisal, which is based on “rural county” and not “rural area.”  The CFPB publishes a list of counties that are entirely rural to facilitate compliance with the exemption in § 1026.35(c)(4)(vii)(H).

                                            The tool provides a sample comma separated values (CSV) file to help you determine how to format the addresses for upload in the multiple address search tool.  For best results, the street address, city, state and ZIP Code should be included in the batch upload file or address entry.  The addresses within this CSV file should follow the rules set forth in Section 2, “Postal Addressing Standards” of the United States Postal Service Publication 28 - Postal Addressing Standards (<a href="http://pe.usps.gov/text/pub28/welcome.htm" title="Publication 28,">http://pe.usps.gov/text/pub28/welcome.htm</a>).  Per <a href="http://pe.usps.gov/text/pub28/28c2_001.htm" title="Publication 28, Sub-Section 21">Publication 28, Sub-Section 21</a>, a complete property address consists of the “Delivery Address Line” and the “Last Line.”  “Delivery Address Line,” in the example below and in the tool CSV file format, consists of the “Street address” while the “Last Line,” in the example below and in the tool CSV file format, consists of three fields, “City”, “State” and “ZIP”.

First, verify the address is correct.  If it is correct, try the Census Bureau’s automated address search tool, use the rural or underserved counties lists, or check the form of the address on the United States Postal Service site (<a href="https://tools.usps.com/go/ZipLookupAction_input" title="United States Postal Service site">https://tools.usps.com/go/ZipLookupAction_input</a>).  For instance, the address 6009 JFK Blvd East, West New York, NJ 07093 cannot be located by the tool.  When the address is entered into the usps.com site, the proper address is given, 6009 Kennedy Blvd E, West New York, NJ 07093-3740, and the address can now be identified in the tool.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>

                                            It is possible that some addresses are too new to appear in the tool, and addresses that could not be identified may be attempted again 60, 90 or 120 days later. If an update or change to an address is required, make the change in your systems of record first, then retry the upload.  For best results, include the street address, city, state and ZIP Code in the batch upload file or your address entry.
