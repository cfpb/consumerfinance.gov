<h1>Planning how you’ll get to work</h1>
<p class="lead-paragraph u-mt0">Getting to work on time is important for keeping your job. Having a plan and a backup option is a good idea in case you get into a bind. We'll help you figure out your best option for getting to work, how to budget for it, and what to do if you need a backup plan.
</p>
<p class="u-mb0">Meet Mya and Frankie. They’ll help you think about your plan.</p>

    <p class="h2 u-mt15">Mya plans to bike to work</p>
    <p class="u-mt20">
      Mya decided to bike to work because there’s a bikeshare near her school. Bikeshares allow you to borrow a bike from different self-service bike stations around the city. Mya heads straight to work from class &mdash; some days she has time to walk, but usually she’s in a rush and biking is faster.
    </p>
    <p class="h3">
      Mya’s long-term goal
    </p>
    <p>Mya wants to buy an annual bikeshare membership since her youth employment program offers a special rate and it’d be a better deal than paying per ride. The $60 annual membership works out to a little over $1 per week (over 52 weeks in a year). In order to save money for this, Mya will walk to work two days a week for the next few months.</p>

    <p class="h2 u-mt15">Frankie plans to take the bus</p>
    <p class="u-mt20">Frankie doesn’t live near public transportation, so he usually gets a ride to the closest bus stop. The bus ride is about 25 minutes long, so he leaves his house at 7:10 a.m. to allow enough time to get dropped off, ride the bus, and arrive at work before his 8 a.m. shift starts.</p>
    <p class="h3">
      Frankie’s long-term goal
    </p>
    <p>Frankie will take the bus five days a week, but over the next year, he will save up to buy a car so he doesn’t have to rely on friends and family for rides to the bus stop. While he's saving up for a car, he will buy a $50 monthly bus pass because it’s more cost-effective than paying $2 each way for a bus ticket.</p>
