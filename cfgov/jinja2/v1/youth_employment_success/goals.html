<h1>Planning how you’ll get to work</h1>
<p class="lead-paragraph u-mt0">Getting to work on time is important for keeping your job. Having a plan and a backup option is a good idea in case you get into a bind.</p>
<p>
  This tool will help you figure out your best option for getting to work, how to budget for it, and what to do if you need a backup plan.
</p>
<p class="u-mb0">Meet Mya and Frankie. They’ll help you think about your plan.</p>

    <p class="u-mt20">
      Mya decides to bike because it will allow her to save money. Since she doesn't live near public transit or have a car, biking is her best option. She puts aside $20/month to cover bike repairs.

      Mya’s long-term goal
    </p>
    <p>Mya's long-term goal is to buy an electric bike and someday a car, but in the meantime, she will save money by riding her bike and will take rideshares when she gets stuck.</p>

    <p class="u-mt20">Frankie decides to take the bus because it conveniently drops him off near work. The bus ride is about 30 minutes long so he leaves his house at 7:15 AM to allow enough time to get there before his 8 AM shift starts.</p>
    <p class="h3">
      Frankie’s long-term goal
    </p>
    <p>Frankie's long-term goal is to save up for a car. He buys a $50 monthly bus pass instead of spending $2 per bus ride, allowing him to set aside the extra money he saves each month.</p>
