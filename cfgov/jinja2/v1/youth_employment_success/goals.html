<h1 class="h1">Planning how you’ll get to work</h1>
<p class="lead-paragraph u-mt0">Let’s make a plan for how you’ll get to work—getting to work on time is important for keeping your job. Having a plan and a backup option can help you be prepared so you don’t get in a bind. This tool will help you figure out your best option for getting to work and how to budget for it.</p>
<p>Meet Mya and Frankie, they’ll help you think about your own long-term goal.</p>

    <p class="h2 u-mt15">Mya plans to bike to work</p>
    <p class="u-mt20">Mya decided to bike to work because there’s a bikeshare near her school. Bikeshares allow you to borrow a bike from different self-service bike stations around the city. Mya heads straight to work from class—some days she has time to walk, but usually she’s in a rush and biking is faster.</p>
    <p class="h3">
      <b>Mya’s long-term goal</b>
    </p>
    <p>I want to buy an annual bikeshare membership since my school offers a special student rate and it’d be a better deal than paying per ride. The $60 annual membership works out to a little over $1 per week. In order to save money for this, I will walk to work two days a week for the next few months.</p>

    <p class="h2 u-mt15">Frankie plans to take the bus</p>
    <p class="u-mt20">Frankie doesn’t live near public transportation so he usually gets a ride to the closest bus stop. The bus ride is about 25 minutes long so he leaves his house at 7:10am to allow enough time to get dropped off, ride the bus, and arrive at work before his 8am shift starts.</p>
    <p class="h3">
      <b>Frankie’s long-term goal</b>
    </p>
    <p>I will take the bus five days a week, but over the next year, I’d like to save up enough money to buy a car so I don’t have to rely on friends and family for rides to the bus stop. In the meantime, I will buy a $50 monthly bus pass because it’s more cost-effective than paying $2 each way for a bus ticket.</p>

  Now let’s think through your long-term goal. Figuring out your long-term goal may help you figure out the best way to get to work now while you’re working towards this goal.
