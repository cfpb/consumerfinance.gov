            Richard Cordray is the director of the CFPB. David Silberman is the acting deputy director.
            We post their calendars online after reviewing it to determine
            whether any information contained therein must or should be withheld from public disclosure
            in accordance with the Freedom of Information Act. We update the calendar
            retrospectively for the months they have occupied these leadership roles.
            We do not post current or future calendars.
            Due to the time-intensive preparation process, each
            month’s calendar will appear on this page at least a few weeks after that month has concluded. We
            have also retained the calendars of people who have previously led the day-to-day work of the CFPB.
