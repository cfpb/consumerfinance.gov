            <p> Starting with the legal requirements and the consumer in mind, we began sketching prototype forms for testing.</p>
            <p> During this process, the team discussed preliminary issues and ideas about mortgage disclosures. This session set the context for the disclosures and was a starting point for their development. The team continued to develop these issues and ideas over more than a year during the development process. </p>
