This process benefits you too — providing full information now helps make sure you can keep your home later.</p>\r\n<h2>Expect to work with multiple people associated with your lender.</h2>\r\n<p>Lenders have specialized staff that work on processing and underwriting (approving) your loan.</p>\r\n<h2>If you receive regular income from a non-employment source, be prepared to submit additional documentation.</h2>\r\n<p>You may have regular income from sources other than employment, such as child support, alimony, or rental income. If you rely on this income, the lender needs proof that this income can reasonably be expected to continue in the future at the same level.</p>\r\n<h2>If you have made one or more large deposits into your bank account recently, be prepared to document the source of the money.</h2>\r\n<p>It’s common for home buyers to have large deposits in their bank records, especially when transferring money between accounts in preparation for a home purchase. Lenders are generally required to verify the source of your income and down payment funds. Requirements vary, so ask your lender what documentation you need.</p>",
