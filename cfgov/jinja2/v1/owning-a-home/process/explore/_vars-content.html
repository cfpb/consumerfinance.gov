It’s up to you.</p>\r\n<p>However, don’t wait until you’ve found a home before you start thinking about your loan options. You want to have a pretty good idea what kind of loan is right for you before you put in an offer on a home. The action steps in this phase help you do that. Since there’s no right or wrong time to start looking at homes, we’ve put our home shopping tips at <a href=\"/owning-a-home/process/explore/#home\">the end of this phase</a>.</p>\r\n<h2>Your down payment amount affects your loan choices and your costs.</h2>\r\n<p><a href=\"/owning-a-home/your-down-payment-decision/\">Watch our short video</a> to learn what to consider when choosing how much to put down.  Many homebuyers choose to put less than 20 percent down. When you put less than 20 percent down, you will likely need to pay for mortgage insurance. Mortgage insurance adds to your loan costs, but it helps you get a loan you might otherwise be unable to get. Mortgage insurance protects the lender if you fall behind on your payments, which means lenders are more willing to lend to you. Mortgage insurance doesn’t protect you or pay your mortgage for you. <a href=\"/askcfpb/1953/what-is-mortgage-insurance-and-how-does-it-work.html\" target=\"_blank\">Learn more about mortgage insurance and how it works</a>.</p>\r\n<h2>There are multiple options for buyers with less than a 20% down payment.</h2>\r\n<p>Some options may be cheaper than others depending on your specific circumstances, the local market in your area, and changing general market conditions. Ask lenders in your area what they recommend and why. Common options include:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>A Federal Housing Administration <a href=\"/owning-a-home/loan-options/FHA-loans/\">(FHA) loan</a>.</li>\r\n<li>A <a href=\"/owning-a-home/loan-options/conventional-loans/\">conventional loan</a> with <a href=\"/askcfpb/122/what-is-private-mortgage-insurance-how-does-pmi-work.html\" target=\"_blank\">private mortgage insurance</a> or a <a href=\"/askcfpb/1955/what-is-a-piggyback-second-mortgage.html\" target=\"_blank\">“piggyback” second mortgage</a>.</li>\r\n<li>For active duty servicemembers, veterans, or surviving spouses, a <a href=\"/owning-a-home/loan-options/special-loan-programs/#va\">VA loan</a>.</li>\r\n<li>For residents of small towns or rural areas, <a href=\"/owning-a-home/loan-options/special-loan-programs/#usda\">a USDA loan</a>.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>There may be local down payment assistance programs available to you.</h2>\r\n<p>Many local areas have down payment assistance grant funds available for first-time homebuyers with low and moderate incomes. <a href=\"/owning-a-home/loan-options/special-loan-programs/#local\">Learn more about these kinds of programs</a>.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li class=\"action\">If you’re considering a local program, ask questions and find out whether there are any conditions you have to meet. For example, you may need to pay the money back if you don’t live in the home for a certain amount of time.</li>\r\n</ul>",

Comparison shopping for those services can help you save money. You’ll shop for closing services later on, once you’ve chosen a home, a mortgage loan, and a lender. But if you’re interested in a preview, <a href=\"/owning-a-home/process/close/#services\">learn more about shopping for closing costs</a>.</p>\r\n<h2>The Annual Percentage Rate (APR) helps you compare options.</h2>\r\n<p>The APR is a helpful tool for comparing loan options with different interest rates and fees. It takes into account both the interest rate and fees, so you can see which loan is less expensive over the full loan term. <a href=\"/askcfpb/135/what-is-the-difference-between-a-mortgage-interest-rate-and-an-apr.html\" target=\"_blank\">Learn more about the APR</a>.</p>\r\n<h2>You may see a \"no closing cost loan\" advertised, but that doesn't mean the closing costs are free.</h2>\r\n<p>In most cases, you still pay for the closing costs in a “no closing cost” loan. Typically, you pay in one of two ways:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><i>The costs are rolled into the loan</i>, increasing the total loan amount to cover the closing costs. The larger loan means you pay more interest charges over time. In some cases, the increased loan amount can mean you pay a higher interest rate as well.</li>\r\n<li><i>The costs are rolled into the interest rate.</i> The lender is providing a rebate, known as a lender credit, to cover the closing costs. You pay a higher interest rate for a loan with credits than for a loan without credits.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Either option may be a choice if you’re short on cash for closing.</p>\r\n<h2>Sometimes, the seller may pay some or all of your closing costs, but that doesn’t mean the closing costs are free.</h2>\r\n<p>You would need to negotiate directly with the seller – not the lender – for the seller to pay some of the closing costs. Depending on the particular market in your area, sellers may be more or less willing to pay for some of your closing costs. Typically, sellers might agree to pay closing costs if:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><i>You have agreed to pay more for the home.</i> A seller will usually require a higher purchase price if they are paying for the buyer’s closing costs. For example, a seller might agree to sell the home for $200,000 and contribute $4,000 to your closing costs. But if you did not ask the seller to contribute to your closing costs, the seller would probably have accepted only $196,000 for the home. You’re still paying the $4,000, just as part of your loan instead of as closing costs. Be aware that in this type of situation, the home may not appraise for $200,000, which could cause problems for your loan.</li>\r\n<li><i>The home needs repair.</i> If your home inspection shows that there are costly repairs that need to be made, the seller may offer to contribute to your closing costs instead of making the repairs or reducing the sales price. This reduces your costs at closing, but it doesn’t reduce your overall costs – you will need to spend the money to make the repair yourself after closing.</li>\r\n</ul>",

You need to work with an agent who has the experience to do the best job, which may or may not be your family member or friend.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Research and contact closing service providers.</h2>\r\n<p>Closing on a home involves a lot of third-party services. You can usually choose the provider for some of these servicers, and borrowers that choose their own providers often save money. But when you find the right home, things start to move fast. Now is a good time to also begin researching providers for closing services such as title insurance and settlement agents. <a href=\"/owning-a-home/process/close/#services\">Look ahead to learn more about closing services and how to shop for them</a>.</p>",

State laws may require your real estate agent to tell you who they are representing and under what terms. Ask questions.
