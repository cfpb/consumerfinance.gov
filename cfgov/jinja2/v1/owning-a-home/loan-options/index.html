Use our guide to understand how these choices affect your monthly payment, your overall costs both upfront and over time, and your level of risk.

                        <p>Shorter terms will generally save you money overall, but have higher monthly payments. There are two reasons shorter terms can save you money:  </p>

                        <ol>
                          <li>You are borrowing money and paying interest for a shorter amount of <strong>time</strong>.</li>
                          <li>The <strong>interest rate</strong> is usually lower&mdash;by as much as a full percentage point.</li>

                                <p>Your monthly payments are more likely to be stable with a fixed-rate loan, so you might prefer this option if you value certainty about your loan costs over the long term. With a fixed-rate loan, your interest rate and monthly <a href="/askcfpb/1941/on-a-mortgage-whats-the-difference-between-my-principal-and-interest-payment-and-my-total-monthly-payment.html" target="_blank">principal and interest payment</a> will stay the same. Your <a href="/askcfpb/1941/on-a-mortgage-whats-the-difference-between-my-principal-and-interest-payment-and-my-total-monthly-payment.html" target="_blank">total monthly payment</a> can still change—for example, if your property taxes, homeowner’s insurance, or mortgage insurance might go up or down.</p>

                                <p>Adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) offer less predictability but may be cheaper in the short term. You may want to consider this option if, for example, you plan to move again within the initial fixed period of an ARM. In this case, future rate adjustments may not affect you. However, if you end up staying in your house longer than expected, you may end up paying a lot more. In the later years of an ARM, your interest rate <a href="/askcfpb/1949/for-an-adjustable-rate-mortgage-arm-what-are-the-index-and-margin-and-how-do-they-work.html" target="_blank">changes based on the market</a>, and your monthly principal and interest payment <a href="/askcfpb/1965/how-do-mortgage-lenders-calculate-monthly-payments.html" target="_blank">could go up a lot</a>, even double. <a href="/askcfpb/1947/if-i-am-considering-an-adjustable-rate-mortgage-arm-what-should-i-look-out-for-in-the-fine-print.html" target="_blank">Learn more</a>.</p>

                              <p>Most ARMs have two periods. During the first period, your interest rate is fixed and won’t change. During the second period, your rate goes up and down regularly based on market changes. <a href="/askcfpb/1949/for-an-adjustable-rate-mortgage-arm-what-are-the-index-and-margin-and-how-do-they-work.html" target="_blank">Learn more about how adjustable rates change</a>.
