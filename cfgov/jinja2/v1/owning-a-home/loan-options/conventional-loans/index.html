          <p>“Conventional” just means that the loan is not part of a specific government program. Conventional loans typically cost less than <a href="../FHA-loans/" target="_blank">FHA loans</a> but can be more difficult to get.</p>
          <p>There are two main categories of conventional loans:</p>
          <p><strong>Conforming loans</strong> have maximum loan amounts that are set by the government. Other rules for conforming loans are set by <a href="/askcfpb/1959/what-are-fannie-mae-and-freddie-mac.html" target="_blank">Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac</a>, companies that provide backing for conforming loans.</p>
          <p><strong>Non-conforming loans</strong> are less standardized. Eligibility, pricing, and features can vary widely by lender, so it’s particularly important to shop around and compare several offers. </p>

          <h3>Mortgage insurance: what you need to know</h3>

          <p><strong>Mortgage insurance helps you get a loan you wouldn’t otherwise be able to.</strong> If you can’t afford a 20 percent down payment, you will likely have to pay for mortgage insurance. You may choose to get a conventional loan with private mortgage insurance (PMI), or an FHA, VA, or USDA loan.</p>
          <p><strong>Mortgage insurance usually adds to your costs.</strong> Depending on the loan type, you will pay monthly mortgage insurance premiums, an upfront mortgage insurance fee, or both. </p>
          <p><strong>Mortgage insurance protects the lender if you fall behind on your payments. It does not protect you.</strong> Your credit score will suffer and you may face foreclosure if you don’t pay your mortgage on time. </p>
