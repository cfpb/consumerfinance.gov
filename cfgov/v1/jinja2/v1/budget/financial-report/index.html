            Each fiscal year, the Chief Financial Officer releases a report on the Bureau’s finances.
            This report analyzes how we allocate funds and how we’ve done at meeting our stated goals for
            the year. We include financial statements and audit findings. Between annual reports, we
            also publish quarterly updates on the current state of the Bureau’s financial resources.
