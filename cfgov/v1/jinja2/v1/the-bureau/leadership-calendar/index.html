            At the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, we are committed to letting you
            know how we’re working for you every day by, among other things, providing you
            with a view into the workday of the CFPB’s senior leadership.
        </p>
        <p>
            Richard Cordray is the Director of the CFPB. Meredith Fuchs is the Deputy Director.
            We post their calendars online, typically on a monthly basis, after reviewing it to determine
            whether any information contained therein must or should be withheld from public disclosure
            in accordance with the Freedom of Information Act. We update the calendar
            retrospectively for the months they have occupied these leadership roles. We do not post
            current or future calendars. Due to the time-intensive preparation process, each
            month’s calendar will appear on this page a few weeks after that month has concluded. We
            have also retained the calendars of people who have previously lead the day-to-day work of the CFPB.
