             For the slick stylesheet to pick up its font and img reference the
             fonts and images found at /src/vendor/slick-carousel/slick/ should
             be included in same directory as slick.css.
             However, including the slick fonts makes the dots on the
             /the-bureau/ page at mobile sizes enormous.
