{#
    In order to flip the sidebar on arabic pages, a new layout-2-1-rtl template
    is created that applies CSS grid classes to position the layout.
    This is intended as a temporary layout until additional page types can have
    their particular layout classes reconcilated with these new CSS grid
    classes.
    TODO: convert layout-2-1 to a grid layout.
