    <h1>The Bureau</h1>
    <p class="lead-paragraph">
        We aim to make consumer financial markets work for consumers,
        responsible providers, and the economy as a whole.
        We protect consumers from unfair, deceptive, or abusive practices
        and take action against companies that break the law.
        We arm people with the information, steps, and tools
        that they need to make smart financial decisions.

        In a market that works, the prices, risks, and terms of the deal
        are clear upfront so that consumers can understand their options
        and comparison shop.
        Companies all play by the same consumer protection rules
        and compete fairly on providing quality and service.
        To achieve this vision, the CFPB works to:

            <p>
                The CFPB was created to provide a single point of
                accountability for enforcing federal consumer financial laws
                and protecting consumers in the
                financial marketplace.
                Before, that responsibility was divided among several agencies.
                Today, itâ€™s our primary focus.
