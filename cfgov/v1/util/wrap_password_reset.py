# This wrapper is used to check our custom password-reset routine, in urls.py:

# In Wagtail 2, it was converted to a mixin (PasswordResetEnabledViewMixin)
# and used to build reset views, as opposed to wrapping them.
# We may want to follow that pattern in our password routine, or review
# our entire custom setup, but this PR is too big already.
# So for now, we resurrect the wrapper to serve our custom routine.
