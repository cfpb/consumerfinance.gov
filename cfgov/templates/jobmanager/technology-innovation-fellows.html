But they also build tools for themselves, to ensure their products are stable, resilient, and secure. Designers are also critical to CFPB's software development process: with a foundation in user-centered design, the Design team develops the Bureau's visual brand, custom front-end software, and produces editorial videos, photography, and webcasts.</p>

                        <h4>User Experience (UX) Designer </h4>
                        <p>UX designers represent the User's needs throughout the development process of the CFPB's products and applications by conducting research, gathering content requirements, determining information architecture, conducting usability tests, and designing interactions, navigation, and interfaces.</p>

                        <p>Software Developer fellows specialize in one of three disciplines: API and Web Developers  work with Python, JavaScript, Clojure, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and Git to build software for our website and tools for Bureau staff. Software Delivery Automators  shepherd unit/integration, browser, and load testing; continuous delivery; and monitoring. They rely on Jenkins, TravisCI, Selenium WebDriver, Python/Behave/Gherkin, SauceLabs, and JMeter, and are eager to expand their toolkit. Infrastructure Automation Engineers (DevOps) architect, build, and secure cloud environments that are resilient, performant, and scalable using tools like Puppet, Simian Army, Edda, and Ice. These professionals fix server-layer issues, write software and scripts to prevent issue recurrence, and build infrastructure to support the Bureau's software solutions. </p>

                        <p>Technology contributes to every facet of the CFPB's work. Our near-term goals include:</p>
                        <ul class="padded-ul">
                            <li><b>Empowering consumers:</b> People need fair, unbiased, and understandable information about their finances. Help us design the tools and disclosures that millions of people rely upon to make financial choices.</b></li>

                            <li><b>Providing market insight:</b> Are foreclosures up? Are credit card debts reaching a tipping point? What's driving student loan defaults? Help us analyze market data to spot financial trends and ensure that institutions are complying with the law.</li>

                            <li><b>Bringing regulatory examination into the digital age:</b> The CFPB employs examiners who monitor the practices of consumer financial institutions. It's important that they do that job well. They need the best tools possible. Help us innovate the tools they need to do their work.</li>

                            <li><b>Assisting consumers directly:</b> Our Consumer Response team facilitates solving real problems for people in difficult financial situations with few places to turn. Help us help consumers.</li>

                            <li><b>Improving government:</b> Use technology to create an organization that feels and acts like a small team instead of a large one; and monitor our progress through data analytics to ensure our work reaches its intended audience, both inside the Bureau and across the country. </li>

                            <li><b>Building our foundation:</b> Achieving these goals requires stable, secure infrastructure that meets stringent federal guidelines. Help us lead the effort to exceed them.</li>

                            <li><b>Employing advanced analytics:</b> Increasingly allow Bureau decisions to be data-driven, using techniques such as machine learning, pattern recognition, and distributed systems to inform everything from enforcement to consumer education to rulemaking.

                        <h3>What is a CFPB Technology and Innovation Fellowship?</h3>
                        <p>It is a two-year program for software developers, web designers, security engineers, and data architects and analysts to work with the CFPB to perform the work of a vital government agency, serve millions of consumers, and support the consumer financial marketplace.</p>

                        <h3>What should I know about applying for a federal job?</h3>
                        <p>When we begin taking applications, this page will have links to the vacancy announcement (job posting) for each position on USAJobs.gov. When applying, make sure to pay careful attention to the minimum qualification standards for each position, which will be listed on the USAJobs.gov announcement under the “Qualifications Required" heading. You must ensure that your resume, or other materials attached to your application, clearly show how you meet the required qualifications.</p>

                        <p>The <a href="http://www.opm.gov/">Office of Personnel Management</a> has additional information about applying for a federal job and using USAJobs.gov. You can review <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahg1fselvMg">this video</a> made by OPM for an overview of the federal job application process, as well as <a href="http://www.opm.gov/FAQs/">OPM's FAQ</a> for those seeking a federal job.</p>

                        <h3>What skills are you looking for?</h3>
                        <p>We're looking for back-end and front-end web developers, UX designers, graphic designers, cybersecurity engineers and tool developers, and data architects and analysts. But more than that, we're looking for people who are curious, bring diverse backgrounds and perspectives, can communicate well with non- technical people, and are passionate about solving problems. We are looking for highly-skilled, creative individuals that love learning new things and are eager to serve the American public.</p>

                        <h3>What does the CFPB offer?</h3>
                        <p>The CFPB is an equal opportunity employer. We offer a workplace that is respectful, fair, and values diversity. CFPB offers comprehensive benefits in addition to salary, including: ten paid holidays, ability to accrue up to 13 days of vacation time and 13 days of sick leave each year, a wide range of health insurance plans, coverage for pre-existing conditions, and no waiting periods (we pay up to 75% of your health insurance premium), dental, vision, and life insurance, and flexible spending accounts for health care and dependent care.</p>

                        <h3>Where will I work?</h3>
                        <p>You can work from anywhere in the United States (subject to all applicable Bureau policies and procedures) or at our headquarters in Washington D.C.</p>

                        <h3>What will I need if I work from home?</h3>
                        <p>You will need a strong broadband connection to support video conferencing and other remote collaboration tools. Other necessary equipment will be provided to you.</p>

                        <h3>How often will I travel?</h3>
                        <p>You will travel at least quarterly to regroup with the entire Technology team at our headquarters. Other travel will depend on your projects.</p>

                        <h3>What will the average day be like?</h3>
                        <p>Maybe you'll work side-by-side with an economist, helping spot trends in the marketplace. Maybe you'll redesign forms and disclosures so that they are easier for the public to understand. You may help maintain the CFPB's API catalog, working with outside developers to make the most of our public data.  Or maybe you'll create fundamental tools for the Bureau that will be used for years after your fellowship ends.</p>

                        <p>You'll likely spend a lot of time working directly with mission partners, learning the finer points of their work to help you build better tools for them. Intellectual curiosity and good communication are an essential part of this job. You'll also spend a lot of time with your cohorts and with the rest of the Technology team.</p>

                        <h3>What tools will I use?</h3>
                        <p>Developers: We develop on Macs using a wide variety of languages. On the back end, we tend to develop custom web applications using Python (often with Django), but we also develop with Clojure and PHP (consumerfinance.gov is partly powered by WordPress). On the front end, we use Grunt and Bower to manage our HTML5, Less, and JavaScript codebases. We use GitHub to manage all of our code. For automated testing and continuous integration we use Selenium and Jenkins.</p>

                        <p>Designers: We use the latest Adobe Creative Suite, as well as GitHub to manage prototypes, feedback, and bugs.</p>

                        <p>Security engineers: We use a combination of open source and industry-leading technologies including intrusion detection/prevention systems, firewalls, vulnerability & compliance scanners, antivirus, and more. We're evaluating and implementing new technologies across the organization.</p>

                        <p>Data experts: Our data architecture is primarily PostgreSQL- and MS SQL-based, though we're always looking into other scalable platforms and tools. For data science, we use R, Python (NumPy, SciPy, scikit-learn, etc.), Julia, or whatever tools are necessary for analyzing data (as well as some Stata and SAS for older projects). For web analytics, we use Google Analytics and supporting tools, Tableau, paid search, and SEO tools (plus some data science and visualization tools).</p>

                        <h3>What if I don't know how to use those tools? Can I still apply?</h3>
                        <p>Some of our work must be done according to the standards we've already set. But we're open to applicants with other backgrounds, especially those who are eager to share their knowledge with us. If you like to learn new tools and technologies and pick them up very easily, we want to hear from you.</p>

                        <h3>Are there any other requirements?</h3>
                        <p>You must be a US Citizen to be considered. </p>

                        <h3>Will anyone see my work?</h3>
                        <p>Yes. Per <a href="https://github.com/cfpb/source-code-policy/blob/gh-pages/cfpb-source-code-policy.txt">our source code policy</a>, we make as much of our work available to the public as possible. We also discuss some of the technical details of our work on GitHub.</p>

                        <h3>What if I have more questions?</h3>
                        <p>Feel free to contact us directly at <a href="mailto:tech@consumerfinance.gov">tech@consumerfinance.gov</a>.</p>
