    <h2>What the Division Does</h2>
    <p>CFPB has designed a supervision program to ensure that banks and nonbanks comply with federal consumer financial laws and to detect and assess the risks to consumers that arise from these businesses.</p>

    <p>This consumer-centered approach to supervision is based on three main principles:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Focus on risks to consumers in the policies and practices of consumer financial providers,</li>
        <li>Analyze available data on the activities of providers, on the markets in which they operate, and on the risks to consumers, and</li>
        <li>Apply consistent standards in supervision of both bank and nonbank consumer financial companies.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act created the CFPB and gave it critical consumer protection oversight authority &mdash; promoting greater accountability for American consumers.  With this authority, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has the ability to examine for and monitor compliance with federal consumer financial laws and regulations at both large banks and nonbank financial services companies.</p>
    <p>The CFPB has primary authority to enforce federal consumer financial laws for banks and other depository institutions with total assets of more than $10 billion, and their affiliates, which collectively hold more than 80 percent of the banking industry's assets.  The CFPB also has the authority to oversee nonbank compliance, regardless of size, in certain specific markets: mortgage companies (originators, brokers, and servicers, as well as providers of loan modification or foreclosure relief services); payday lenders; and private education lenders.  For other nonbank markets, the CFPB can also supervise "larger participants" after defining them by rule.</p>
    <p>CFPB supervision is a comprehensive, ongoing process of pre-examination scoping and review of information, data analysis, on-site examinations, and regular communication with supervised entities and prudential regulators, as well as follow-up monitoring. For most depository institutions supervised by the CFPB, periodic examinations will be conducted. For the largest and most complex banks in the country, the agency has implemented a year-round supervision program that will be customized to reflect the consumer protection risk profile of the organization.  The agency has implemented a risk-based nonbank supervision program that will include conducting individual examinations and may also include requiring reports from businesses to determine what businesses need greater focus.</p>
