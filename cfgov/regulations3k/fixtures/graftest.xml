<HEAD>Supplement I to Part 1002 - Official Interpretations
</HEAD>
<HD1>Introduction</HD1>
<P>1.<I>Official status.</I> Section 706(e) of the Equal Credit Opportunity Act protects a creditor from civil liability for any act done or omitted in good faith in conformity with an interpretation issued by a duly authorized official of the Bureau. This commentary is the means by which the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection issues official interpretations of Regulation B. Good-faith compliance with this commentary affords a creditor protection under section 706(e) of the Act.
</P>
<HD1>Section 1002.1 - Authority, Scope, and Purpose
</HD1>
<P><I>1(a) Authority and scope.</I>
</P>
<P>1. <I>Scope.</I> The Equal Credit Opportunity Act and Regulation B apply to all credit - commercial as well as personal - without regard to the nature or type of the credit or the creditor, except for an entity excluded from coverage of this part (but not the Act) by section 1029 of the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010 (12 U.S.C. 5519). If a transaction provides for the deferral of the payment of a debt, it is credit covered by Regulation B even though it may not be a credit transaction covered by Regulation Z (Truth in Lending) (12 CFR part 1026). Further, the definition of creditor is not restricted to the party or person to whom the obligation is initially payable, as is the case under Regulation Z. Moreover, the Act and regulation apply to all methods of credit evaluation, whether performed judgmentally or by use of a credit scoring system.
</P>
<HD2>1(a)(1)</HD2>
<P>2. <I>Foreign applicability.</I> Regulation B generally does not apply to lending activities that occur outside the United States. The regulation does apply to lending activities that take place within the United States (as well as the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and any territory or possession of the United States), whether or not the applicant is a citizen.

</P>
<P>1. <I>Application for credit.</I> If the applicant applied in accordance with the creditor's procedures, a refusal to refinance or extend the term of a business or other loan is adverse action.

<HEAD>§ 1003.1   Authority, purpose, and scope.</HEAD>
<P>(a) <I>Authority.</I> This part, known as Regulation C, is issued by the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection (Bureau) pursuant to the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) (12 U.S.C. 2801 <I>et seq.,</I>) as amended. The information-collection requirements have been approved by the U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under 44 U.S.C. 3501 <I>et seq.</I> and have been assigned OMB numbers for institutions reporting data to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (1557-0159), the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (3064-0046), the Federal Reserve System (7100-0247), the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) (2502-0529), the National Credit Union Administration (3133-0166), and the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection (3170-0008).
</P>
<P>(b) <I>Purpose.</I> (1) This part implements the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, (i)which is intended to provide the public with loan data that can be used:
</P>
<P>(ii) To help determine whether financial institutions are serving the housing needs of their communities;
</P>
<P>(iii) To assist public officials in distributing public-sector investment so as to attract private investment to areas where it is needed; and
</P>
<P>(iv) To assist in identifying possible discriminatory lending patterns and enforcing antidiscrimination statutes.
</P>
<P>(2) Neither the act nor this part is intended to encourage unsound lending practices or the allocation of credit.
</P>
<P>(c) <I>Scope.</I> This part applies to financial institutions as defined in § 1003.2(g). This part requires a financial institution to submit data to the appropriate Federal agency for the financial institution as defined in § 1003.5(a)(4), and to disclose certain data to the public, about covered loans for which the financial institution receives applications, or that it originates or purchases, and that are secured by a dwelling located in a State of the United States of America, the District of Columbia, or the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.
