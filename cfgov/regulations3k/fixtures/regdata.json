        "subpart": 1,
        "contents": "\r\n{1002-4}   \r\n(a) Discrimination. A creditor shall not discriminate against an applicant on a prohibited basis regarding any aspect of a credit transaction.\r\n\r\n{1002-4-a-Interp}  \r\nOfficial Interpretation to 4(a)\r\n\r\nParagraph 4(a).\r\n\r\n1. Scope of rule. The general rule stated in \u00a7\u00a01002.4(a) covers all dealings, without exception, between an applicant and a creditor, whether or not addressed by other provisions of the regulation. Other provisions of the regulation identify specific practices that the Bureau has decided are impermissible because they could result in credit discrimination on a basis prohibited by the Act. The general rule covers, for example, application procedures, criteria used to evaluate creditworthiness, administration of accounts, and treatment of delinquent or slow accounts. Thus, whether or not specifically prohibited elsewhere in the regulation, a credit practice that treats applicants differently on a prohibited basis violates the law because it violates the general rule. Disparate treatment on a prohibited basis is illegal whether or not it results from a conscious intent to discriminate.\r\n\r\n2. Examples.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ni. Disparate treatment would exist, for example, in the following situations:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA. A creditor provides information only on \u201csubprime\u201d and similar products to minority applicants who request information about the creditor's mortgage products, but provides information on a wider variety of mortgage products to similarly situated nonminority applicants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nB. A creditor provides more comprehensive information to men than to similarly situated women.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nC. A creditor requires a minority applicant to provide greater documentation to obtain a loan than a similarly situated nonminority applicant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nD. A creditor waives or relaxes credit standards for a nonminority applicant but not for a similarly situated minority applicant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nii. Treating applicants differently on a prohibited basis is unlawful if the creditor lacks a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for its action, or if the asserted reason is found to be a pretext for discrimination.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSee this interpretation in Supplement I\r\n\r\n{1002-4-b}  \r\n(b) Discouragement. A creditor shall not make any oral or written statement, in advertising or otherwise, to applicants or prospective applicants that would discourage on a prohibited basis a reasonable person from making or pursuing an application.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{1002-4-b-Interp}  \r\nOfficial Interpretation to 4(b)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Paragraph 4(b).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Prospective applicants. Generally, the regulation's protections apply only to persons who have requested or received an extension of credit. In keeping with the purpose of the Act\u2014to promote the availability of credit on a nondiscriminatory basis\u2014\u00a7\u00a01002.4(b) covers acts or practices directed at prospective applicants that could discourage a reasonable person, on a prohibited basis, from applying for credit. Practices prohibited by this section include:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ni. A statement that the applicant should not bother to apply, after the applicant states that he is retired.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nii. The use of words, symbols, models or other forms of communication in advertising that express, imply, or suggest a discriminatory preference or a policy of exclusion in violation of the Act.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\niii. The use of interview scripts that discourage applications on a prohibited basis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Affirmative advertising. A creditor may affirmatively solicit or encourage members of traditionally disadvantaged groups to apply for credit, especially groups that might not normally seek credit from that creditor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSee this interpretation in Supplement I\r\n\r\n{1002-4-c}  \r\n(c) Written applications. A creditor shall take written applications for the dwelling-related types of credit covered by \u00a7\u00a01002.13(a).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{1002-4-c-Interp}  \r\nOfficial Interpretation to 4(c)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Paragraph 4(c).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Requirement for written applications. Model application forms are provided in Appendix B to the regulation, although use of a printed form is not required. A creditor will satisfy the requirement by writing down the information that it normally considers in making a credit decision. The creditor may complete an application on behalf of an applicant and need not require the applicant to sign the application.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Telephone applications. A creditor that accepts applications by telephone for dwelling-related credit covered by \u00a7\u00a01002.13 can meet the requirement for written applications by writing down pertinent information that is provided by the applicant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3. Computerized entry. Information entered directly into and retained by a computerized system qualifies as a written application under this paragraph. (See the commentary to \u00a7\u00a01002.13(b), Applications through electronic media and Applications through video.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSee this interpretation in Supplement I\r\n\r\n{1002-4-d}  \r\n(d) Form of disclosures \u2014\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(1) General rule. A creditor that provides in writing any disclosures or information required by this part must provide the disclosures in a clear and conspicuous manner and, except for the disclosures required by \u00a7\u00a7\u00a01002.5 and 1002.13, in a form the applicant may retain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(2) Disclosures in electronic form. The disclosures required by this part that are required to be given in writing may be provided to the applicant in electronic form, subject to compliance with the consumer consent and other applicable provisions of the Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act (E-Sign Act) (15 U.S.C. 7001 et seq.). Where the disclosures under \u00a7\u00a7\u00a01002.5(b)(1), 1002.5(b)(2), 1002.5(d)(1), 1002.5(d)(2), 1002.13, and 1002.14(a)(2) accompany an application accessed by the applicant in electronic form, these disclosures may be provided to the applicant in electronic form on or with the application form, without regard to the consumer consent or other provisions of the E-Sign Act.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{1002-4-d-Interp}  \r\nOfficial Interpretation to 4(d)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Paragraph 4(d).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Clear and conspicuous. This standard requires that disclosures be presented in a reasonably understandable format in a way that does not obscure the required information. No minimum type size is mandated, but the disclosures must be legible, whether typewritten, handwritten, or printed by computer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Form of disclosures. Whether the disclosures required to be on or with an application must be in electronic form depends upon the following:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ni. If an applicant accesses a credit application electronically (other than as described under ii below), such as online at a home computer, the creditor must provide the disclosures in electronic form (such as with the application form on its Web site) in order to meet the requirement to provide disclosures in a timely manner on or with the application. If the creditor instead mailed paper disclosures to the applicant, this requirement would not be met.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nii. In contrast, if an applicant is physically present in the creditor's office, and accesses a credit application electronically, such as via a terminal or kiosk (or if the applicant uses a terminal or kiosk located on the premises of an affiliate or third party that has arranged with the creditor to provide applications to consumers), the creditor may provide disclosures in either electronic or paper form, provided the creditor complies with the timing, delivery, and retainability requirements of the regulation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSee this interpretation in Supplement I\r\n\r\n{1002-4-d-1}  \r\n(1) General rule. A creditor that provides in writing any disclosures or information required by this part must provide the disclosures in a clear and conspicuous manner and, except for the disclosures required by \u00a7\u00a7\u00a01002.5 and 1002.13, in a form the applicant may retain.\r\n\r\n{1002-4-d-2}  \r\n(2) Disclosures in electronic form. The disclosures required by this part that are required to be given in writing may be provided to the applicant in electronic form, subject to compliance with the consumer consent and other applicable provisions of the Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act (E-Sign Act) (15 U.S.C. 7001 et seq.). Where the disclosures under \u00a7\u00a7\u00a01002.5(b)(1), 1002.5(b)(2), 1002.5(d)(1), 1002.5(d)(2), 1002.13, and 1002.14(a)(2) accompany an application accessed by the applicant in electronic form, these disclosures may be provided to the applicant in electronic form on or with the application form, without regard to the consumer consent or other provisions of the E-Sign Act.\r\n\r\n{1002-4-e}  \r\n(e) Foreign-language disclosures. Disclosures may be made in languages other than English, provided they are available in English upon request.\r\n{0d561a54c76f7c03d949d39319ea909bf955df12ad981ff609f81311}  \r\nPrevious section - \u00a7\u00a01002.3  Limited exceptions for certain classes of transactions.\r\n{734e256ab307b8005f6ef258455a281434c24f0beadc024ec41de2b5}  \r\nNext section - \u00a7\u00a01002.5 Rules concerning requests for information.",

This part, known as Regulation B, is issued by the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection (Bureau) pursuant to Title VII (Equal Credit Opportunity Act) of the Consumer Credit Protection Act, as amended (15 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.). Except as otherwise provided herein, this part applies to all persons who are creditors, as defined in \u00a7\u00a01002.2(l), other than a person excluded from coverage of this part by section 1029 of the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010, Title X of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, Public Law 111-203, 124 Stat. 1376. Information collection requirements contained in this part have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget under the provisions of 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. and have been assigned OMB No. 3170-0013.\r\n\r\nsee(1-a-Interp)\r\n\r\n{b}\r\n(b) Purpose. The purpose of this part is to promote the availability of credit to all creditworthy applicants without regard to race, color, religion, national origin, sex, marital status, or age (provided the applicant has the capacity to contract); to the fact that all or part of the applicant's income derives from a public assistance program; or to the fact that the applicant has in good faith exercised any right under the Consumer Credit Protection Act. The regulation prohibits creditor practices that discriminate on the basis of any of these factors. The regulation also requires creditors to notify applicants of action taken on their applications; to report credit history in the names of both spouses on an account; to retain records of credit applications; to collect information about the applicant's race and other personal characteristics in applications for certain dwelling-related loans; and to provide applicants with copies of appraisal reports used in connection with credit transactions.",

        "contents": "\n\n{1002-2}   \n(a) Account means an extension of credit. When employed in relation to an account, the word use refers only to open-end credit.\n\n{1002-2-b}  \n(b) Act means the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (Title VII of the Consumer Credit Protection Act).\n\n{1002-2-c}  \n(c) Adverse action\n\n\n\n\n(1) The term means:\n\n\n\n\n\n(i) A refusal to grant credit in substantially the amount or on substantially the terms requested in an application unless the creditor makes a counteroffer (to grant credit in a different amount or on other terms) and the applicant uses or expressly accepts the credit offered;\n\n\n\n\n{1002-2-c-1-i-Interp}  \nOfficial Interpretation to 2(c)(1)(i)\n\n\n\n\n\n Paragraph 2(c)(1)(i).\n\n\n\n1. Application for credit. If the applicant applied in accordance with the creditor's procedures, a refusal to refinance or extend the term of a business or other loan is adverse action.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee this interpretation in Supplement I\n\n\n\n(ii) A termination of an account or an unfavorable change in the terms of an account that does not affect all or substantially all of a class of the creditor's accounts; or\n\n\n\n\n{1002-2-c-1-ii-Interp}  \nOfficial Interpretation to 2(c)(1)(ii)\n\n\n\n\n\n Paragraph 2(c)(1)(ii).\n\n\n\n1. Move from service area. If a credit card issuer terminates the open-end account of a customer because the customer has moved out of the card issuer's service area, the termination is adverse action unless termination on this ground was explicitly provided for in the credit agreement between the parties. In cases where termination is adverse action, notification is required under \u00a7\u00a01002.9.\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Termination based on credit limit. If a creditor terminates credit accounts that have low credit limits (for example, under $400) but keeps open accounts with higher credit limits, the termination is adverse action and notification is required under \u00a7\u00a01002.9.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee this interpretation in Supplement I\n\n\n\n(iii) A refusal to increase the amount of credit available to an applicant who has made an application for an increase.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(2) The term does not include:\n\n\n\n\n\n(i) A change in the terms of an account expressly agreed to by an applicant;\n\n\n\n\n\n(ii) Any action or forbearance relating to an account taken in connection with inactivity, default, or delinquency as to that account;\n\n\n\n\n{1002-2-c-2-ii-Interp}  \nOfficial Interpretation to 2(c)(2)(ii)\n\n\n\n\n\n Paragraph 2(c)(2)(ii).\n\n\n\n1. Default\u2014exercise of due-on-sale clause. If a mortgagor sells or transfers mortgaged property without the consent of the mortgagee, and the mortgagee exercises its contractual right to accelerate the mortgage loan, the mortgagee may treat the mortgagor as being in default. An adverse action notice need not be given to the mortgagor or the transferee. (See comment 2(e)-1 for treatment of a purchaser who requests to assume the loan.)\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Current delinquency or default. The term adverse action does not include a creditor's termination of an account when the accountholder is currently in default or delinquent on that account. Notification in accordance with \u00a7\u00a01002.9 of the regulation generally is required, however, if the creditor's action is based on a past delinquency or default on the account.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee this interpretation in Supplement I\n\n\n\n(iii) A refusal or failure to authorize an account transaction at point of sale or loan, except when the refusal is a termination or an unfavorable change in the terms of an account that does not affect all or substantially all of a class of the creditor's accounts, or when the refusal is a denial of an application for an increase in the amount of credit available under the account;\n\n\n\n\n{1002-2-c-2-iii-Interp}  \nOfficial Interpretation to 2(c)(2)(iii)\n\n\n\n\n\n Paragraph 2(c)(2)(iii).\n\n\n\n1. Point-of-sale transactions. Denial of credit at point of sale is not adverse action except under those circumstances specified in the regulation. For example, denial at point of sale is not adverse action in the following situations:\n\n\n\n\n\ni. A credit cardholder presents an expired card or a card that has been reported to the card issuer as lost or stolen.\n\n\n\n\n\nii. The amount of a transaction exceeds a cash advance or credit limit.\n\n\n\n\n\niii. The circumstances (such as excessive use of a credit card in a short period of time) suggest that fraud is involved.\n\n\n\n\n\niv. The authorization facilities are not functioning.\n\n\n\n\n\nv. Billing statements have been returned to the creditor for lack of a forwarding address.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Application for increase in available credit. A refusal or failure to authorize an account transaction at the point of sale or loan is not adverse action except when the refusal is a denial of an application, submitted in accordance with the creditor's procedures, for an increase in the amount of credit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee this interpretation in Supplement I\n\n\n\n(iv) A refusal to extend credit because applicable law prohibits the creditor from extending the credit requested; or\n\n\n\n\n\n(v) A refusal to extend credit because the creditor does not offer the type of credit or credit plan requested.\n\n\n\n\n{1002-2-c-2-v-Interp}  \nOfficial Interpretation to 2(c)(2)(v)\n\n\n\n\n\n Paragraph 2(c)(2)(v).\n\n\n\n1. Terms of credit versus type of credit offered. When an applicant applies for credit and the creditor does not offer the credit terms requested by the applicant (for example, the interest rate, length of maturity, collateral, or amount of downpayment), a denial of the application for that reason is adverse action (unless the creditor makes a counteroffer that is accepted by the applicant) and the applicant is entitled to notification under \u00a7\u00a01002.9.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee this interpretation in Supplement I\n\n\n\n\n\n(3) An action that falls within the definition of both paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section is governed by paragraph (c)(2) of this section.\n\n{1002-2-c-1}  \n(1) The term means:\n\n\n\n\n\n(i) A refusal to grant credit in substantially the amount or on substantially the terms requested in an application unless the creditor makes a counteroffer (to grant credit in a different amount or on other terms) and the applicant uses or expressly accepts the credit offered;\n\n\n\n\n{1002-2-c-1-i-Interp}  \nOfficial Interpretation to 2(c)(1)(i)\n\n\n\n\n\n Paragraph 2(c)(1)(i).\n\n\n\n1. Application for credit. If the applicant applied in accordance with the creditor's procedures, a refusal to refinance or extend the term of a business or other loan is adverse action.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee this interpretation in Supplement I\n\n\n\n(ii) A termination of an account or an unfavorable change in the terms of an account that does not affect all or substantially all of a class of the creditor's accounts; or\n\n\n\n\n{1002-2-c-1-ii-Interp}  \nOfficial Interpretation to 2(c)(1)(ii)\n\n\n\n\n\n Paragraph 2(c)(1)(ii).\n\n\n\n1. Move from service area. If a credit card issuer terminates the open-end account of a customer because the customer has moved out of the card issuer's service area, the termination is adverse action unless termination on this ground was explicitly provided for in the credit agreement between the parties. In cases where termination is adverse action, notification is required under \u00a7\u00a01002.9.\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Termination based on credit limit. If a creditor terminates credit accounts that have low credit limits (for example, under $400) but keeps open accounts with higher credit limits, the termination is adverse action and notification is required under \u00a7\u00a01002.9.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee this interpretation in Supplement I\n\n\n\n(iii) A refusal to increase the amount of credit available to an applicant who has made an application for an increase.\n\n{1002-2-c-1-i}  \n(i) A refusal to grant credit in substantially the amount or on substantially the terms requested in an application unless the creditor makes a counteroffer (to grant credit in a different amount or on other terms) and the applicant uses or expressly accepts the credit offered;\n\n\n\n\n{1002-2-c-1-i-Interp}  \nOfficial Interpretation to 2(c)(1)(i)\n\n\n\n\n\n Paragraph 2(c)(1)(i).\n\n\n\n1.

In cases where termination is adverse action, notification is required under \u00a7\u00a01002.9.\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Termination based on credit limit. If a creditor terminates credit accounts that have low credit limits (for example, under $400) but keeps open accounts with higher credit limits, the termination is adverse action and notification is required under \u00a7\u00a01002.9.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee this interpretation in Supplement I\n\n{1002-2-c-1-iii}  \n(iii) A refusal to increase the amount of credit available to an applicant who has made an application for an increase.\n\n{1002-2-c-2}  \n(2) The term does not include:\n\n\n\n\n\n(i) A change in the terms of an account expressly agreed to by an applicant;\n\n\n\n\n\n(ii) Any action or forbearance relating to an account taken in connection with inactivity, default, or delinquency as to that account;\n\n\n\n\n{1002-2-c-2-ii-Interp}  \nOfficial Interpretation to 2(c)(2)(ii)\n\n\n\n\n\n Paragraph 2(c)(2)(ii).\n\n\n\n1. Default\u2014exercise of due-on-sale clause. If a mortgagor sells or transfers mortgaged property without the consent of the mortgagee, and the mortgagee exercises its contractual right to accelerate the mortgage loan, the mortgagee may treat the mortgagor as being in default. An adverse action notice need not be given to the mortgagor or the transferee. (See comment 2(e)-1 for treatment of a purchaser who requests to assume the loan.)\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Current delinquency or default. The term adverse action does not include a creditor's termination of an account when the accountholder is currently in default or delinquent on that account. Notification in accordance with \u00a7\u00a01002.9 of the regulation generally is required, however, if the creditor's action is based on a past delinquency or default on the account.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee this interpretation in Supplement I\n\n\n\n(iii) A refusal or failure to authorize an account transaction at point of sale or loan, except when the refusal is a termination or an unfavorable change in the terms of an account that does not affect all or substantially all of a class of the creditor's accounts, or when the refusal is a denial of an application for an increase in the amount of credit available under the account;\n\n\n\n\n{1002-2-c-2-iii-Interp}  \nOfficial Interpretation to 2(c)(2)(iii)\n\n\n\n\n\n Paragraph 2(c)(2)(iii).\n\n\n\n1. Point-of-sale transactions. Denial of credit at point of sale is not adverse action except under those circumstances specified in the regulation. For example, denial at point of sale is not adverse action in the following situations:\n\n\n\n\n\ni. A credit cardholder presents an expired card or a card that has been reported to the card issuer as lost or stolen.\n\n\n\n\n\nii. The amount of a transaction exceeds a cash advance or credit limit.\n\n\n\n\n\niii. The circumstances (such as excessive use of a credit card in a short period of time) suggest that fraud is involved.\n\n\n\n\n\niv. The authorization facilities are not functioning.\n\n\n\n\n\nv. Billing statements have been returned to the creditor for lack of a forwarding address.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Application for increase in available credit. A refusal or failure to authorize an account transaction at the point of sale or loan is not adverse action except when the refusal is a denial of an application, submitted in accordance with the creditor's procedures, for an increase in the amount of credit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee this interpretation in Supplement I\n\n\n\n(iv) A refusal to extend credit because applicable law prohibits the creditor from extending the credit requested; or\n\n\n\n\n\n(v) A refusal to extend credit because the creditor does not offer the type of credit or credit plan requested.\n\n\n\n\n{1002-2-c-2-v-Interp}  \nOfficial Interpretation to 2(c)(2)(v)\n\n\n\n\n\n Paragraph 2(c)(2)(v).\n\n\n\n1.

Notification in accordance with \u00a7\u00a01002.9 of the regulation generally is required, however, if the creditor's action is based on a past delinquency or default on the account.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee this interpretation in Supplement I\n\n{1002-2-c-2-iii}  \n(iii) A refusal or failure to authorize an account transaction at point of sale or loan, except when the refusal is a termination or an unfavorable change in the terms of an account that does not affect all or substantially all of a class of the creditor's accounts, or when the refusal is a denial of an application for an increase in the amount of credit available under the account;\n\n\n\n\n{1002-2-c-2-iii-Interp}  \nOfficial Interpretation to 2(c)(2)(iii)\n\n\n\n\n\n Paragraph 2(c)(2)(iii).\n\n\n\n1. Point-of-sale transactions. Denial of credit at point of sale is not adverse action except under those circumstances specified in the regulation. For example, denial at point of sale is not adverse action in the following situations:\n\n\n\n\n\ni. A credit cardholder presents an expired card or a card that has been reported to the card issuer as lost or stolen.\n\n\n\n\n\nii. The amount of a transaction exceeds a cash advance or credit limit.\n\n\n\n\n\niii.

Billing statements have been returned to the creditor for lack of a forwarding address.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Application for increase in available credit. A refusal or failure to authorize an account transaction at the point of sale or loan is not adverse action except when the refusal is a denial of an application, submitted in accordance with the creditor's procedures, for an increase in the amount of credit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee this interpretation in Supplement I\n\n{1002-2-c-2-iv}  \n(iv) A refusal to extend credit because applicable law prohibits the creditor from extending the credit requested; or\n\n{1002-2-c-2-v}  \n(v) A refusal to extend credit because the creditor does not offer the type of credit or credit plan requested.\n\n\n\n\n{1002-2-c-2-v-Interp}  \nOfficial Interpretation to 2(c)(2)(v)\n\n\n\n\n\n Paragraph 2(c)(2)(v).\n\n\n\n1. Terms of credit versus type of credit offered. When an applicant applies for credit and the creditor does not offer the credit terms requested by the applicant (for example, the interest rate, length of maturity, collateral, or amount of downpayment), a denial of the application for that reason is adverse action (unless the creditor makes a counteroffer that is accepted by the applicant) and the applicant is entitled to notification under \u00a7\u00a01002.9.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee this interpretation in Supplement I\n\n{1002-2-c-3}  \n(3) An action that falls within the definition of both paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section is governed by paragraph (c)(2) of this section.\n\n{1002-2-d}  \n(d) Age refers only to the age of natural persons and means the number of fully elapsed years from the date of an applicant's birth.\n\n{1002-2-e}  \n(e) Applicant means any person who requests or who has received an extension of credit from a creditor, and includes any person who is or may become contractually liable regarding an extension of credit. For purposes of \u00a7\u00a01002.7(d), the term includes guarantors, sureties, endorsers, and similar parties.\n\n\n\n\n{1002-2-e-Interp}  \nOfficial Interpretation to 2(e)\n\n\n\n\n\n 2(e) Applicant.\n\n\n\n1. Request to assume loan. If a mortgagor sells or transfers the mortgaged property and the buyer makes an application to the creditor to assume the mortgage loan, the mortgagee must treat the buyer as an applicant unless its policy is not to permit assumptions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee this interpretation in Supplement I\n\n{1002-2-f}  \n(f) Application means an oral or written request for an extension of credit that is made in accordance with procedures used by a creditor for the type of credit requested. The term application does not include the use of an account or line of credit to obtain an amount of credit that is within a previously established credit limit. A completed application means an application in connection with which a creditor has received all the information that the creditor regularly obtains and considers in evaluating applications for the amount and type of credit requested (including, but not limited to, credit reports, any additional information requested from the applicant, and any approvals or reports by governmental agencies or other persons that are necessary to guarantee, insure, or provide security for the credit or collateral). The creditor shall exercise reasonable diligence in obtaining such information.\n\n\n\n\n{1002-2-f-Interp}  \nOfficial Interpretation to 2(f)\n\n\n\n\n\n 2(f) Application.\n\n\n\n1. General. A creditor has the latitude under the regulation to establish its own application process and to decide the type and amount of information it will require from credit applicants.\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Procedures used. The term \u201cprocedures\u201d refers to the actual practices followed by a creditor for making credit decisions as well as its stated application procedures. For example, if a creditor's stated policy is to require all applications to be in writing on the creditor's application form, but the creditor also makes credit decisions based on oral requests, the creditor's procedures are to accept both oral and written applications.\n\n\n\n\n\n3. When an inquiry or prequalification request becomes an application. A creditor is encouraged to provide consumers with information about loan terms. However, if in giving information to the consumer the creditor also evaluates information about the consumer, decides to decline the request, and communicates this to the consumer, the creditor has treated the inquiry or prequalification request as an application and must then comply with the notification requirements under \u00a7\u00a01002.9. Whether the inquiry or prequalification request becomes an application depends on how the creditor responds to the consumer, not on what the consumer says or asks. (See comment 9-5 for further discussion of prequalification requests; see comment 2(f)-5 for a discussion of preapproval requests.)\n\n\n\n\n\n4. Examples of inquiries that are not applications. The following examples illustrate situations in which only an inquiry has taken place:\n\n\n\n\n\ni. A consumer calls to ask about loan terms and an employee explains the creditor's basic loan terms, such as interest rates, loan-to-value ratio, and debt-to-income ratio.\n\n\n\n\n\nii. A consumer calls to ask about interest rates for car loans, and, in order to quote the appropriate rate, the loan officer asks for the make and sales price of the car and the amount of the downpayment, then gives the consumer the rate.\n\n\n\n\n\niii. A consumer asks about terms for a loan to purchase a home and tells the loan officer her income and intended downpayment, but the loan officer only explains the creditor's loan-to-value ratio policy and other basic lending policies, without telling the consumer whether she qualifies for the loan.\n\n\n\n\n\niv. A consumer calls to ask about terms for a loan to purchase vacant land and states his income and the sales price of the property to be financed, and asks whether he qualifies for a loan; the employee responds by describing the general lending policies, explaining that he would need to look at all of the consumer's qualifications before making a decision, and offering to send an application form to the consumer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5. Examples of an application. An application for credit includes the following situations:\n\n\n\n\n\ni. A person asks a financial institution to \u201cpreapprove\u201d her for a loan (for example, to finance a house or a vehicle she plans to buy) and the institution reviews the request under a program in which the institution, after a comprehensive analysis of her creditworthiness, issues a written commitment valid for a designated period of time to extend a loan up to a specified amount. The written commitment may not be subject to conditions other than conditions that require the identification of adequate collateral, conditions that require no material change in the applicant's financial condition or creditworthiness prior to funding the loan, and limited conditions that are not related to the financial condition or creditworthiness of the applicant that the lender ordinarily attaches to a traditional application (such as certification of a clear termite inspection for a home purchase loan, or a maximum mileage requirement for a used car loan). But if the creditor's program does not provide for giving written commitments, requests for preapprovals are treated as prequalification requests for purposes of the regulation.\n\n\n\n\n\nii. Under the same facts as above, the financial institution evaluates the person's creditworthiness and determines that she does not qualify for a preapproval.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6. Completed application\u2014diligence requirement. The regulation defines a completed application in terms that give a creditor the latitude to establish its own information requirements. Nevertheless, the creditor must act with reasonable diligence to collect information needed to complete the application. For example, the creditor should request information from third parties, such as a credit report, promptly after receiving the application. If additional information is needed from the applicant, such as an address or a telephone number to verify employment, the creditor should contact the applicant promptly. (But see comment 9(a)(1)-3, which discusses the creditor's option to deny an application on the basis of incompleteness.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee this interpretation in Supplement I\n\n{1002-2-g}  \n(g) Business credit refers to extensions of credit primarily for business or commercial (including agricultural) purposes, but excluding extensions of credit of the types described in \u00a7\u00a7\u00a01002.3(a)-(d).\n\n\n\n\n{1002-2-g-Interp}  \nOfficial Interpretation to 2(g)\n\n\n\n\n\n 2(g) Business credit.\n\n\n\n1. Definition. The test for deciding whether a transaction qualifies as business credit is one of primary purpose. For example, an open-end credit account used for both personal and business purposes is not business credit unless the primary purpose of the account is business-related. A creditor may rely on an applicant's statement of the purpose for the credit requested.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee this interpretation in Supplement I\n\n{1002-2-h}  \n(h) Consumer credit means credit extended to a natural person primarily for personal, family, or household purposes.\n\n{1002-2-i}  \n(i) Contractually liable means expressly obligated to repay all debts arising on an account by reason of an agreement to that effect.\n\n{1002-2-j}  \n(j) Credit means the right granted by a creditor to an applicant to defer payment of a debt, incur debt and defer its payment, or purchase property or services and defer payment therefor.\n\n\n\n\n{1002-2-j-Interp}  \nOfficial Interpretation to 2(j)\n\n\n\n\n\n 2(j) Credit.\n\n\n\n1. General. Regulation B covers a wider range of credit transactions than Regulation Z (Truth in Lending). Under Regulation B, a transaction is credit if there is a right to defer payment of a debt\u2014regardless of whether the credit is for personal or commercial purposes, the number of installments required for repayment, or whether the transaction is subject to a finance charge.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee this interpretation in Supplement I\n\n{1002-2-k}  \n(k) Credit card means any card, plate, coupon book, or other single credit device that may be used from time to time to obtain money, property, or services on credit.\n\n{1002-2-l}  \n(l) Creditor means a person who, in the ordinary course of business, regularly participates in a credit decision, including setting the terms of the credit. The term creditor includes a creditor's assignee, transferee, or subrogee who so participates. For purposes of \u00a7\u00a7\u00a01002.4(a) and (b), the term creditor also includes a person who, in the ordinary course of business, regularly refers applicants or prospective applicants to creditors, or selects or offers to select creditors to whom requests for credit may be made. A person is not a creditor regarding any violation of the Act or this part committed by another creditor unless the person knew or had reasonable notice of the act, policy, or practice that constituted the violation before becoming involved in the credit transaction. The term does not include a person whose only participation in a credit transaction involves honoring a credit card.\n\n\n\n\n{1002-2-l-Interp}  \nOfficial Interpretation to 2(l)\n\n\n\n\n\n 2(l) Creditor.\n\n\n\n1. Assignees. The term creditor includes all persons participating in the credit decision. This may include an assignee or a potential purchaser of the obligation who influences the credit decision by indicating whether or not it will purchase the obligation if the transaction is consummated.\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Referrals to creditors. For certain purposes, the term creditor includes persons such as real estate brokers, automobile dealers, home builders, and home-improvement contractors who do not participate in credit decisions but who only accept applications and refer applicants to creditors, or select or offer to select creditors to whom credit requests can be made. These persons must comply with \u00a7\u00a01002.4(a), the general rule prohibiting discrimination, and with \u00a7\u00a01002.4(b), the general rule against discouraging applications.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee this interpretation in Supplement I\n\n{1002-2-m}  \n(m) Credit transaction means every aspect of an applicant's dealings with a creditor regarding an application for credit or an existing extension of credit (including, but not limited to, information requirements; investigation procedures; standards of creditworthiness; terms of credit; furnishing of credit information; revocation, alteration, or termination of credit; and collection procedures).\n\n{1002-2-n}  \n(n) Discriminate against an applicant means to treat an applicant less favorably than other applicants.\n\n{1002-2-o}  \n(o) Elderly means age 62 or older.\n\n{1002-2-p}  \n(p) Empirically derived and other credit scoring systems.\n\n\n\n\n(1) A credit scoring system is a system that evaluates an applicant's creditworthiness mechanically, based on key attributes of the applicant and aspects of the transaction, and that determines, alone or in conjunction with an evaluation of additional information about the applicant, whether an applicant is deemed creditworthy. To qualify as an empirically derived, demonstrably and statistically sound, credit scoring system, the system must be:\n\n\n\n\n\n(i) Based on data that are derived from an empirical comparison of sample groups or the population of creditworthy and non-creditworthy applicants who applied for credit within a reasonable preceding period of time;\n\n\n\n\n\n(ii) Developed for the purpose of evaluating the creditworthiness of applicants with respect to the legitimate business interests of the creditor utilizing the system (including, but not limited to, minimizing bad debt losses and operating expenses in accordance with the creditor's business judgment);\n\n\n\n\n\n(iii) Developed and validated using accepted statistical principles and methodology; and\n\n\n\n\n\n(iv) Periodically revalidated by the use of appropriate statistical principles and methodology and adjusted as necessary to maintain predictive ability.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(2) A creditor may use an empirically derived, demonstrably and statistically sound, credit scoring system obtained from another person or may obtain credit experience from which to develop such a system. Any such system must satisfy the criteria set forth in paragraph (p)(1)(i) through (iv) of this section; if the creditor is unable during the development process to validate the system based on its own credit experience in accordance with paragraph (p)(1) of this section, the system must be validated when sufficient credit experience becomes available. A system that fails this validity test is no longer an empirically derived, demonstrably and statistically sound, credit scoring system for that creditor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{1002-2-p-Interp}  \nOfficial Interpretation to 2(p)\n\n\n\n\n\n 2(p) Empirically derived and other credit scoring systems\n\n\n\n1. Purpose of definition. The definition under \u00a7\u00a7\u00a01002.2(p)(1)(i) through (iv) sets the criteria that a credit system must meet in order to use age as a predictive factor. Credit systems that do not meet these criteria are judgmental systems and may consider age only for the purpose of determining a \u201cpertinent element of creditworthiness.\u201d (Both types of systems may favor an elderly applicant. See \u00a7\u00a01002.6(b)(2).)\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Periodic revalidation. The regulation does not specify how often credit scoring systems must be revalidated. The credit scoring system must be revalidated frequently enough to ensure that it continues to meet recognized professional statistical standards for statistical soundness. To ensure that predictive ability is being maintained, the creditor must periodically review the performance of the system. This could be done, for example, by analyzing the loan portfolio to determine the delinquency rate for each score interval, or by analyzing population stability over time to detect deviations of recent applications from the applicant population used to validate the system. If this analysis indicates that the system no longer predicts risk with statistical soundness, the system must be adjusted as necessary to reestablish its predictive ability. A creditor is responsible for ensuring its system is validated and revalidated based on the creditor's own data.\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Pooled data scoring systems. A scoring system or the data from which to develop such a system may be obtained from either a single credit grantor or multiple credit grantors. The resulting system will qualify as an empirically derived, demonstrably and statistically sound, credit scoring system provided the criteria set forth in paragraph (p)(1)(i) through (iv) of this section are met. A creditor is responsible for ensuring its system is validated and revalidated based on the creditor's own data when it becomes available.\n\n\n\n\n\n4. Effects test and disparate treatment. An empirically derived, demonstrably and statistically sound, credit scoring system may include age as a predictive factor (provided that the age of an elderly applicant is not assigned a negative factor or value). Besides age, no other prohibited basis may be used as a variable. Generally, credit scoring systems treat all applicants objectively and thus avoid problems of disparate treatment. In cases where a credit scoring system is used in conjunction with individual discretion, disparate treatment could conceivably occur in the evaluation process. In addition, neutral factors used in credit scoring systems could nonetheless be subject to challenge under the effects test. (See comment 6(a)-2 for a discussion of the effects test).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee this interpretation in Supplement I\n\n{1002-2-p-1}  \n(1) A credit scoring system is a system that evaluates an applicant's creditworthiness mechanically, based on key attributes of the applicant and aspects of the transaction, and that determines, alone or in conjunction with an evaluation of additional information about the applicant, whether an applicant is deemed creditworthy. To qualify as an empirically derived, demonstrably and statistically sound, credit scoring system, the system must be:\n\n\n\n\n\n(i) Based on data that are derived from an empirical comparison of sample groups or the population of creditworthy and non-creditworthy applicants who applied for credit within a reasonable preceding period of time;\n\n\n\n\n\n(ii) Developed for the purpose of evaluating the creditworthiness of applicants with respect to the legitimate business interests of the creditor utilizing the system (including, but not limited to, minimizing bad debt losses and operating expenses in accordance with the creditor's business judgment);\n\n\n\n\n\n(iii) Developed and validated using accepted statistical principles and methodology; and\n\n\n\n\n\n(iv) Periodically revalidated by the use of appropriate statistical principles and methodology and adjusted as necessary to maintain predictive ability.\n\n{1002-2-p-1-i}  \n(i) Based on data that are derived from an empirical comparison of sample groups or the population of creditworthy and non-creditworthy applicants who applied for credit within a reasonable preceding period of time;\n\n{1002-2-p-1-ii}  \n(ii) Developed for the purpose of evaluating the creditworthiness of applicants with respect to the legitimate business interests of the creditor utilizing the system (including, but not limited to, minimizing bad debt losses and operating expenses in accordance with the creditor's business judgment);\n\n{1002-2-p-1-iii}  \n(iii) Developed and validated using accepted statistical principles and methodology; and\n\n{1002-2-p-1-iv}  \n(iv) Periodically revalidated by the use of appropriate statistical principles and methodology and adjusted as necessary to maintain predictive ability.\n\n{1002-2-p-2}  \n(2) A creditor may use an empirically derived, demonstrably and statistically sound, credit scoring system obtained from another person or may obtain credit experience from which to develop such a system. Any such system must satisfy the criteria set forth in paragraph (p)(1)(i) through (iv) of this section; if the creditor is unable during the development process to validate the system based on its own credit experience in accordance with paragraph (p)(1) of this section, the system must be validated when sufficient credit experience becomes available. A system that fails this validity test is no longer an empirically derived, demonstrably and statistically sound, credit scoring system for that creditor.\n\n{1002-2-q}  \n(q) Extend credit and extension of credit mean the granting of credit in any form (including, but not limited to, credit granted in addition to any existing credit or credit limit; credit granted pursuant to an open-end credit plan; the refinancing or other renewal of credit, including the issuance of a new credit card in place of an expiring credit card or in substitution for an existing credit card; the consolidation of two or more obligations; or the continuance of existing credit without any special effort to collect at or after maturity).\n\n{1002-2-r}  \n(r) Good faith means honesty in fact in the conduct or transaction.\n\n{1002-2-s}  \n(s) Inadvertent error means a mechanical, electronic, or clerical error that a creditor demonstrates was not intentional and occurred notwithstanding the maintenance of procedures reasonably adapted to avoid such errors.\n\n{1002-2-t}  \n(t) Judgmental system of evaluating applicants means any system for evaluating the creditworthiness of an applicant other than an empirically derived, demonstrably and statistically sound, credit scoring system.\n\n{1002-2-u}  \n(u) Marital status means the state of being unmarried, married, or separated, as defined by applicable state law. The term \u201cunmarried\u201d includes persons who are single, divorced, or widowed.\n\n{1002-2-v}  \n(v) Negative factor or value, in relation to the age of elderly applicants, means utilizing a factor, value, or weight that is less favorable regarding elderly applicants than the creditor's experience warrants or is less favorable than the factor, value, or weight assigned to the class of applicants that are not classified as elderly and are most favored by a creditor on the basis of age.\n\n{1002-2-w}  \n(w) Open-end credit means credit extended under a plan in which a creditor may permit an applicant to make purchases or obtain loans from time to time directly from the creditor or indirectly by use of a credit card, check, or other device.\n\n\n\n\n{1002-2-w-Interp}  \nOfficial Interpretation to 2(w)\n\n\n\n\n\n 2(w) Open-end credit.\n\n\n\n1. Open-end real estate mortgages. The term \u201copen-end credit\u201d does not include negotiated advances under an open-end real estate mortgage or a letter of credit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee this interpretation in Supplement I\n\n{1002-2-x}  \n(x) Person means a natural person, corporation, government or governmental subdivision or agency, trust, estate, partnership, cooperative, or association.\n\n{1002-2-y}  \n(y) Pertinent element of creditworthiness, in relation to a judgmental system of evaluating applicants, means any information about applicants that a creditor obtains and considers and that has a demonstrable relationship to a determination of creditworthiness.\n\n{1002-2-z}  \n(z) Prohibited basis means race, color, religion, national origin, sex, marital status, or age (provided that the applicant has the capacity to enter into a binding contract); the fact that all or part of the applicant's income derives from any public assistance program; or the fact that the applicant has in good faith exercised any right under the Consumer Credit Protection Act or any state law upon which an exemption has been granted by the Bureau.\n\n\n\n\n{1002-2-z-Interp}  \nOfficial Interpretation to 2(z)\n\n\n\n\n\n 2(z) Prohibited basis.\n\n\n\n1. Persons associated with applicant. As used in this part, prohibited basis refers not only to characteristics\u2014the race, color, religion, national origin, sex, marital status, or age\u2014of an applicant (or officers of an applicant in the case of a corporation) but also to the characteristics of individuals with whom an applicant is affiliated or with whom the applicant associates. This means, for example, that under the general rule stated in \u00a7\u00a01002.4(a), a creditor may not discriminate against an applicant because of that person's personal or business dealings with members of a certain religion, because of the national origin of any persons associated with the extension of credit (such as the tenants in the apartment complex being financed), or because of the race of other residents in the neighborhood where the property offered as collateral is located.\n\n\n\n\n\n2. National origin. A creditor may not refuse to grant credit because an applicant comes from a particular country but may take the applicant's immigration status into account. A creditor may also take into account any applicable law, regulation, or executive order restricting dealings with citizens (or the government) of a particular country or imposing limitations regarding credit extended for their use.\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Public assistance program. Any Federal, state, or local governmental assistance program that provides a continuing, periodic income supplement, whether premised on entitlement or need, is \u201cpublic assistance\u201d for purposes of the regulation. The term includes (but is not limited to) Temporary Aid to Needy Families, food stamps, rent and mortgage supplement or assistance programs, social security and supplemental security income, and unemployment compensation. Only physicians, hospitals, and others to whom the benefits are payable need consider Medicare and Medicaid as public assistance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee this interpretation in Supplement I\n\n{1002-2-aa}  \n(aa) State means any state, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, or any territory or possession of the United States.\n{450817c0c67eae47565f29fca34226b197b7ca12798e3cd4066356e0}  \nPrevious section - \u00a7\u00a01002.1  Authority, scope and purpose.\n{aab5a041060173fefa98deb45cf98b7ea4258801c62f2348789fd664}  \nNext section - \u00a7\u00a01002.3 Limited exceptions for certain classes of transactions.",

Security deposits. A utility company is a creditor when it supplies utility service and bills the user after the service has been provided. Thus, any credit term (such as a requirement for a security deposit) is subject to the regulation's bar against discrimination on a prohibited basis.\r\n\r\n3. Telephone companies. A telephone company's credit transactions qualify for the exceptions provided in \u00a7\u00a01002.3(a)(2) only if the company is regulated by a government unit or files the charges for service, delayed payment, or any discount for prompt payment with a government unit.\r\n\r\nSee this interpretation in Supplement I\r\n\r\n{1002-3-a-1}  \r\n(1) Definition.

Persons such as loan brokers and correspondents do not violate the ECOA or Regulation B if they collect information that they are otherwise prohibited from collecting, where the purpose of collecting the information is to provide it to a creditor that is subject to the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act or another Federal or state statute or regulation requiring data collection.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee this interpretation in Supplement I\n\n{1002-5-a-3}  \n(3) Special-purpose credit. A creditor may obtain information that is otherwise restricted to determine eligibility for a special purpose credit program, as provided in \u00a7\u00a7\u00a01002.8(b), (c), and (d).\n\n{1002-5-b}  \n(b) Limitation on information about race, color, religion, national origin, or sex. A creditor shall not inquire about the race, color, religion, national origin, or sex of an applicant or any other person in connection with a credit transaction, except as provided in paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section.\n\n\n\n\n\n(1) Self-test. A creditor may inquire about the race, color, religion, national origin, or sex of an applicant or any other person in connection with a credit transaction for the purpose of conducting a self-test that meets the requirements of \u00a7\u00a01002.15. A creditor that makes such an inquiry shall disclose orally or in writing, at the time the information is requested, that:\n\n\n\n\n\n(i) The applicant will not be required to provide the information;\n\n\n\n\n\n(ii) The creditor is requesting the information to monitor its compliance with the Federal Equal Credit Opportunity Act;\n\n\n\n\n\n(iii) Federal law prohibits the creditor from discriminating on the basis of this information, or on the basis of an applicant's decision not to furnish the information; and\n\n\n\n\n\n(iv) If applicable, certain information will be collected based on visual observation or surname if not provided by the applicant or other person.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(2) Sex. An applicant may be requested to designate a title on an application form (such as Ms., Miss, Mr., or Mrs.) if the form discloses that the designation of a title is optional. An application form shall otherwise use only terms that are neutral as to sex.\n\n{1002-5-b-1}  \n(1) Self-test. A creditor may inquire about the race, color, religion, national origin, or sex of an applicant or any other person in connection with a credit transaction for the purpose of conducting a self-test that meets the requirements of \u00a7\u00a01002.15. A creditor that makes such an inquiry shall disclose orally or in writing, at the time the information is requested, that:\n\n\n\n\n\n(i) The applicant will not be required to provide the information;\n\n\n\n\n\n(ii) The creditor is requesting the information to monitor its compliance with the Federal Equal Credit Opportunity Act;\n\n\n\n\n\n(iii) Federal law prohibits the creditor from discriminating on the basis of this information, or on the basis of an applicant's decision not to furnish the information; and\n\n\n\n\n\n(iv) If applicable, certain information will be collected based on visual observation or surname if not provided by the applicant or other person.\n\n{1002-5-b-1-i}  \n(i) The applicant will not be required to provide the information;\n\n{1002-5-b-1-ii}  \n(ii) The creditor is requesting the information to monitor its compliance with the Federal Equal Credit Opportunity Act;\n\n{1002-5-b-1-iii}  \n(iii) Federal law prohibits the creditor from discriminating on the basis of this information, or on the basis of an applicant's decision not to furnish the information; and\n\n{1002-5-b-1-iv}  \n(iv) If applicable, certain information will be collected based on visual observation or surname if not provided by the applicant or other person.\n\n{1002-5-b-2}  \n(2) Sex. An applicant may be requested to designate a title on an application form (such as Ms., Miss, Mr., or Mrs.) if the form discloses that the designation of a title is optional. An application form shall otherwise use only terms that are neutral as to sex.\n\n{1002-5-c}  \n(c) Information about a spouse or former spouse \u2014\n\n\n\n\n\n(1) General rule. Except as permitted in this paragraph, a creditor may not request any information concerning the spouse or former spouse of an applicant.\n\n\n\n\n\n(2) Permissible inquiries. A creditor may request any information concerning an applicant's spouse (or former spouse under paragraph (c)(2)(v) of this section) that may be requested about the applicant if:\n\n\n\n\n\n(i) The spouse will be permitted to use the account;\n\n\n\n\n\n(ii) The spouse will be contractually liable on the account;\n\n\n\n\n\n(iii) The applicant is relying on the spouse's income as a basis for repayment of the credit requested;\n\n\n\n\n\n(iv) The applicant resides in a community property state or is relying on property located in such a state as a basis for repayment of the credit requested; or\n\n\n\n\n\n(v) The applicant is relying on alimony, child support, or separate maintenance payments from a spouse or former spouse as a basis for repayment of the credit requested.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(3) Other accounts of the applicant. A creditor may request that an applicant list any account on which the applicant is contractually liable and to provide the name and address of the person in whose name the account is held. A creditor may also ask an applicant to list the names in which the applicant has previously received credit.\n\n{1002-5-c-1}  \n(1) General rule. Except as permitted in this paragraph, a creditor may not request any information concerning the spouse or former spouse of an applicant.\n\n{1002-5-c-2}  \n(2) Permissible inquiries. A creditor may request any information concerning an applicant's spouse (or former spouse under paragraph (c)(2)(v) of this section) that may be requested about the applicant if:\n\n\n\n\n\n(i) The spouse will be permitted to use the account;\n\n\n\n\n\n(ii) The spouse will be contractually liable on the account;\n\n\n\n\n\n(iii) The applicant is relying on the spouse's income as a basis for repayment of the credit requested;\n\n\n\n\n\n(iv) The applicant resides in a community property state or is relying on property located in such a state as a basis for repayment of the credit requested; or\n\n\n\n\n\n(v) The applicant is relying on alimony, child support, or separate maintenance payments from a spouse or former spouse as a basis for repayment of the credit requested.\n\n{1002-5-c-2-i}  \n(i) The spouse will be permitted to use the account;\n\n{1002-5-c-2-ii}  \n(ii) The spouse will be contractually liable on the account;\n\n{1002-5-c-2-iii}  \n(iii) The applicant is relying on the spouse's income as a basis for repayment of the credit requested;\n\n{1002-5-c-2-iv}  \n(iv) The applicant resides in a community property state or is relying on property located in such a state as a basis for repayment of the credit requested; or\n\n{1002-5-c-2-v}  \n(v) The applicant is relying on alimony, child support, or separate maintenance payments from a spouse or former spouse as a basis for repayment of the credit requested.\n\n{1002-5-c-3}  \n(3) Other accounts of the applicant. A creditor may request that an applicant list any account on which the applicant is contractually liable and to provide the name and address of the person in whose name the account is held. A creditor may also ask an applicant to list the names in which the applicant has previously received credit.\n\n{1002-5-d}  \n(d) Other limitations on information requests \u2014\n\n\n\n\n\n(1) Marital status. If an applicant applies for individual unsecured credit, a creditor shall not inquire about the applicant's marital status unless the applicant resides in a community property state or is relying on property located in such a state as a basis for repayment of the credit requested. If an application is for other than individual unsecured credit, a creditor may inquire about the applicant's marital status, but shall use only the terms married, unmarried, and separated. A creditor may explain that the category unmarried includes single, divorced, and widowed persons.\n\n\n\n\n{1002-5-d-1-Interp}  \nOfficial Interpretation to 5(d)(1)\n\n\n\n\n\n Paragraph 5(d)(1).\n\n\n\n1. Indirect disclosure of prohibited information. The fact that certain credit-related information may indirectly disclose marital status does not bar a creditor from seeking such information. For example, the creditor may ask about:\n\n\n\n\n\ni. The applicant's obligation to pay alimony, child support, or separate maintenance income.\n\n\n\n\n\nii. The source of income to be used as the basis for repaying the credit requested, which could disclose that it is the income of a spouse.\n\n\n\n\n\niii. Whether any obligation disclosed by the applicant has a co-obligor, which could disclose that the co-obligor is a spouse or former spouse.\n\n\n\n\n\niv. The ownership of assets, which could disclose the interest of a spouse.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee this interpretation in Supplement I\n\n\n\n(2) Disclosure about income from alimony, child support, or separate maintenance. A creditor shall not inquire whether income stated in an application is derived from alimony, child support, or separate maintenance payments unless the creditor discloses to the applicant that such income need not be revealed if the applicant does not want the creditor to consider it in determining the applicant's creditworthiness.\n\n\n\n\n{1002-5-d-2-Interp}  \nOfficial Interpretation to 5(d)(2)\n\n\n\n\n\n Paragraph 5(d)(2).\n\n\n\n1. Disclosure about income. The sample application forms in Appendix B to the regulation illustrate how a creditor may inform an applicant of the right not to disclose alimony, child support, or separate maintenance income.\n\n\n\n\n\n2. General inquiry about source of income. Since a general inquiry about the source of income may lead an applicant to disclose alimony, child support, or separate maintenance income, a creditor making such an inquiry on an application form should preface the request with the disclosure required by this paragraph.\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Specific inquiry about sources of income. A creditor need not give the disclosure if the inquiry about income is specific and worded in a way that is unlikely to lead the applicant to disclose the fact that income is derived from alimony, child support, or separate maintenance payments. For example, an application form that asks about specific types of income such as salary, wages, or investment income need not include the disclosure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee this interpretation in Supplement I\n\n\n\n(3) Childbearing, childrearing. A creditor shall not inquire about birth control practices, intentions concerning the bearing or rearing of children, or capability to bear children. A creditor may inquire about the number and ages of an applicant's dependents or about dependent-related financial obligations or expenditures, provided such information is requested without regard to sex, marital status, or any other prohibited basis.\n\n{1002-5-d-1}  \n(1) Marital status. If an applicant applies for individual unsecured credit, a creditor shall not inquire about the applicant's marital status unless the applicant resides in a community property state or is relying on property located in such a state as a basis for repayment of the credit requested. If an application is for other than individual unsecured credit, a creditor may inquire about the applicant's marital status, but shall use only the terms married, unmarried, and separated. A creditor may explain that the category unmarried includes single, divorced, and widowed persons.\n\n\n\n\n{1002-5-d-1-Interp}  \nOfficial Interpretation to 5(d)(1)\n\n\n\n\n\n Paragraph 5(d)(1).\n\n\n\n1.

Except as otherwise provided in the Act and this part, a creditor may consider any information obtained, so long as the information is not used to discriminate against an applicant on a prohibited basis. The legislative history of the Act indicates that the Congress intended an \u201ceffects test\u201d concept, as outlined in the employment field by the Supreme Court in the cases of Griggs v. Duke Power Co., 401 U.S. 424 (1971), and Albemarle Paper Co. v. Moody, 422 U.S. 405 (1975), to be applicable to a creditor's determination of creditworthiness.\n\n\n\n\n{1002-6-a-Interp}  \nOfficial Interpretation to 6(a)\n\n\n\n\n\n 6(a) General rule concerning use of information.\n\n\n\n1. General. When evaluating an application for credit, a creditor generally may consider any information obtained. However, a creditor may not consider in its evaluation of creditworthiness any information that it is barred by \u00a7\u00a01002.5 from obtaining or from using for any purpose other than to conduct a self-test under \u00a7\u00a01002.15.\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Effects test. The effects test is a judicial doctrine that was developed in a series of employment cases decided by the U.S. Supreme Court under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000e et seq.), and the burdens of proof for such employment cases were codified by Congress in the Civil Rights Act of 1991 (42 U.S.C. 2000e-2). Congressional intent that this doctrine apply to the credit area is documented in the Senate Report that accompanied H.R. 6516, No. 94-589, pp. 4-5; and in the House Report that accompanied H.R. 6516, No. 94-210, p.5. The Act and regulation may prohibit a creditor practice that is discriminatory in effect because it has a disproportionately negative impact on a prohibited basis, even though the creditor has no intent to discriminate and the practice appears neutral on its face, unless the creditor practice meets a legitimate business need that cannot reasonably be achieved as well by means that are less disparate in their impact. For example, requiring that applicants have income in excess of a certain amount to qualify for an overdraft line of credit could mean that women and minority applicants will be rejected at a higher rate than men and nonminority applicants. If there is a demonstrable relationship between the income requirement and creditworthiness for the level of credit involved, however, use of the income standard would likely be permissible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee this interpretation in Supplement I\n\n{1002-6-b}  \n(b) Specific rules concerning use of information.\n\n\n\n\n(1) Except as provided in the Act and this part, a creditor shall not take a prohibited basis into account in any system of evaluating the creditworthiness of applicants.\n\n\n\n\n{1002-6-b-1-Interp}  \nOfficial Interpretation to 6(b)(1)\n\n\n\n\n\n Paragraph 6(b)(1).\n\n\n\n1. Prohibited basis \u2014special purpose credit. In a special purpose credit program, a creditor may consider a prohibited basis to determine whether the applicant possesses a characteristic needed for eligibility. (See \u00a7\u00a01002.8.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee this interpretation in Supplement I\n\n\n\n(2) Age, receipt of public assistance.\n\n\n\n\n(i) Except as permitted in this paragraph, a creditor shall not take into account an applicant's age (provided that the applicant has the capacity to enter into a binding contract) or whether an applicant's income derives from any public assistance program.\n\n\n\n\n\n(ii) In an empirically derived, demonstrably and statistically sound, credit scoring system, a creditor may use an applicant's age as a predictive variable, provided that the age of an elderly applicant is not assigned a negative factor or value.\n\n\n\n\n\n(iii) In a judgmental system of evaluating creditworthiness, a creditor may consider an applicant's age or whether an applicant's income derives from any public assistance program only for the purpose of determining a pertinent element of creditworthiness.\n\n\n\n\n\n(iv) In any system of evaluating creditworthiness, a creditor may consider the age of an elderly applicant when such age is used to favor the elderly applicant in extending credit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{1002-6-b-2-Interp}  \nOfficial Interpretation to 6(b)(2)\n\n\n\n\n\n Paragraph 6(b)(2).\n\n\n\n1. Favoring the elderly. Any system of evaluating creditworthiness may favor a credit applicant who is age 62 or older. A credit program that offers more favorable credit terms to applicants age 62 or older is also permissible; a program that offers more favorable credit terms to applicants at an age lower than 62 is permissible only if it meets the special-purpose credit requirements of \u00a7\u00a01002.8.\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Consideration of age in a credit scoring system. Age may be taken directly into account in a credit scoring system that is \u201cdemonstrably and statistically sound,\u201d as defined in \u00a7\u00a01002.2(p), with one limitation: Applicants age 62 years or older must be treated at least as favorably as applicants who are under age 62. If age is scored by assigning points to an applicant's age category, elderly applicants must receive the same or a greater number of points as the most favored class of nonelderly applicants.\n\n\n\n\n\ni. Age-split scorecards. Some credit systems segment the population and use different scorecards based on the age of an applicant. In such a system, one card may cover a narrow age range (for example, applicants in their twenties or younger) who are evaluated under attributes predictive for that age group. A second card may cover all other applicants, who are evaluated under the attributes predictive for that broader class. When a system uses a card covering a wide age range that encompasses elderly applicants, the credit scoring system is not deemed to score age. Thus, the system does not raise the issue of assigning a negative factor or value to the age of elderly applicants. But if a system segments the population by age into multiple scorecards, and includes elderly applicants in a narrower age range, the credit scoring system does score age. To comply with the Act and regulation in such a case, the creditor must ensure that the system does not assign a negative factor or value to the age of elderly applicants as a class.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Consideration of age in a judgmental system. In a judgmental system, defined in \u00a7\u00a01002.2(t), a creditor may not decide whether to extend credit or set the terms and conditions of credit based on age or information related exclusively to age. Age or age-related information may be considered only in evaluating other \u201cpertinent elements of creditworthiness\u201d that are drawn from the particular facts and circumstances concerning the applicant. For example, a creditor may not reject an application or terminate an account because the applicant is 60 years old. But a creditor that uses a judgmental system may relate the applicant's age to other information about the applicant that the creditor considers in evaluating creditworthiness. As the following examples illustrate, the evaluation must be made in an individualized, case-by-case manner:\n\n\n\n\n\ni. A creditor may consider the applicant's occupation and length of time to retirement to ascertain whether the applicant's income (including retirement income) will support the extension of credit to its maturity.\n\n\n\n\n\nii. A creditor may consider the adequacy of any security offered when the term of the credit extension exceeds the life expectancy of the applicant and the cost of realizing on the collateral could exceed the applicant's equity. An elderly applicant might not qualify for a 5 percent down, 30-year mortgage loan but might qualify with a larger downpayment or a shorter loan maturity.\n\n\n\n\n\niii. A creditor may consider the applicant's age to assess the significance of length of employment (a young applicant may have just entered the job market) or length of time at an address (an elderly applicant may recently have retired and moved from a long-term residence).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4. Consideration of age in a reverse mortgage. A reverse mortgage is a home-secured loan in which the borrower receives payments from the creditor, and does not become obligated to repay these amounts (other than in the case of default) until the borrower dies, moves permanently from the home, or transfers title to the home, or upon a specified maturity date. Disbursements to the borrower under a reverse mortgage typically are determined by considering the value of the borrower's home, the current interest rate, and the borrower's life expectancy. A reverse mortgage program that requires borrowers to be age 62 or older is permissible under \u00a7\u00a01002.6(b)(2)(iv). In addition, under \u00a7\u00a01002.6(b)(2)(iii), a creditor may consider a borrower's age to evaluate a pertinent element of creditworthiness, such as the amount of the credit or monthly payments that the borrower will receive, or the estimated repayment date.\n\n\n\n\n\n5. Consideration of age in a combined system. A creditor using a credit scoring system that qualifies as \u201cempirically derived\u201d under \u00a7\u00a01002.2(p) may consider other factors (such as a credit report or the applicant's cash flow) on a judgmental basis. Doing so will not negate the classification of the credit scoring component of the combined system as \u201cdemonstrably and statistically sound.\u201d While age could be used in the credit scoring portion, however, in the judgmental portion age may not be considered directly. It may be used only for the purpose of determining a \u201cpertinent element of creditworthiness.\u201d (See comment 6(b)(2)-3.)\n\n\n\n\n\n6. Consideration of public assistance. When considering income derived from a public assistance program, a creditor may take into account, for example:\n\n\n\n\n\ni. The length of time an applicant will likely remain eligible to receive such income.\n\n\n\n\n\nii. Whether the applicant will continue to qualify for benefits based on the status of the applicant's dependents (as in the case of Temporary Aid to Needy Families, or social security payments to a minor).\n\n\n\n\n\niii. Whether the creditor can attach or garnish the income to assure payment of the debt in the event of default.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee this interpretation in Supplement I\n\n\n\n(3) Childbearing, childrearing. In evaluating creditworthiness, a creditor shall not make assumptions or use aggregate statistics relating to the likelihood that any category of persons will bear or rear children or will, for that reason, receive diminished or interrupted income in the future.\n\n\n\n\n\n(4) Telephone listing. A creditor shall not take into account whether there is a telephone listing in the name of an applicant for consumer credit but may take into account whether there is a telephone in the applicant's residence.\n\n\n\n\n\n(5) Income. A creditor shall not discount or exclude from consideration the income of an applicant or the spouse of an applicant because of a prohibited basis or because the income is derived from part-time employment or is an annuity, pension, or other retirement benefit; a creditor may consider the amount and probable continuance of any income in evaluating an applicant's creditworthiness. When an applicant relies on alimony, child support, or separate maintenance payments in applying for credit, the creditor shall consider such payments as income to the extent that they are likely to be consistently made.\n\n\n\n\n{1002-6-b-5-Interp}  \nOfficial Interpretation to 6(b)(5)\n\n\n\n\n\n Paragraph 6(b)(5).\n\n\n\n1. Consideration of an individual applicant. A creditor must evaluate income derived from part-time employment, alimony, child support, separate maintenance payments, retirement benefits, or public assistance on an individual basis, not on the basis of aggregate statistics; and must assess its reliability or unreliability by analyzing the applicant's actual circumstances, not by analyzing statistical measures derived from a group.\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Payments consistently made. In determining the likelihood of consistent payments of alimony, child support, or separate maintenance, a creditor may consider factors such as whether payments are received pursuant to a written agreement or court decree; the length of time that the payments have been received; whether the payments are regularly received by the applicant; the availability of court or other procedures to compel payment; and the creditworthiness of the payor, including the credit history of the payor when it is available to the creditor.\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Consideration of income.\n\n\n\n\ni. A creditor need not consider income at all in evaluating creditworthiness. If a creditor does consider income, there are several acceptable methods, whether in a credit scoring or a judgmental system:\n\n\n\n\n\nA. A creditor may score or take into account the total sum of all income stated by the applicant without taking steps to evaluate the income for reliability.\n\n\n\n\n\nB. A creditor may evaluate each component of the applicant's income, and then score or take into account income determined to be reliable separately from other income; or the creditor may disregard that portion of income that is not reliable when it aggregates reliable income.\n\n\n\n\n\nC. A creditor that does not evaluate all income components for reliability must treat as reliable any component of protected income that is not evaluated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nii. In considering the separate components of an applicant's income, the creditor may not automatically discount or exclude from consideration any protected income. Any discounting or exclusion must be based on the applicant's actual circumstances.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4. Part-time employment, sources of income. A creditor may score or take into account the fact that an applicant has more than one source of earned income\u2014a full-time and a part-time job or two part-time jobs. A creditor may also score or treat earned income from a secondary source differently than earned income from a primary source. The creditor may not, however, score or otherwise take into account the number of sources for income such as retirement income, social security, supplemental security income, and alimony. Nor may the creditor treat negatively the fact that an applicant's only earned income is derived from, for example, a part-time job.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee this interpretation in Supplement I\n\n\n\n(6) Credit history. To the extent that a creditor considers credit history in evaluating the creditworthiness of similarly qualified applicants for a similar type and amount of credit, in evaluating an applicant's creditworthiness a creditor shall consider:\n\n\n\n\n\n(i) The credit history, when available, of accounts designated as accounts that the applicant and the applicant's spouse are permitted to use or for which both are contractually liable;\n\n\n\n\n\n(ii) On the applicant's request, any information the applicant may present that tends to indicate the credit history being considered by the creditor does not accurately reflect the applicant's creditworthiness; and\n\n\n\n\n\n(iii) On the applicant's request, the credit history, when available, of any account reported in the name of the applicant's spouse or former spouse that the applicant can demonstrate accurately reflects the applicant's creditworthiness.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{1002-6-b-6-Interp}  \nOfficial Interpretation to 6(b)(6)\n\n\n\n\n\n Paragraph 6(b)(6).\n\n\n\n1. Types of credit references. A creditor may restrict the types of credit history and credit references that it will consider, provided that the restrictions are applied to all credit applicants without regard to sex, marital status, or any other prohibited basis. On the applicant's request, however, a creditor must consider credit information not reported through a credit bureau when the information relates to the same types of credit references and history that the creditor would consider if reported through a credit bureau.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee this interpretation in Supplement I\n\n\n\n(7) Immigration status. A creditor may consider the applicant's immigration status or status as a permanent resident of the United States, and any additional information that may be necessary to ascertain the creditor's rights and remedies regarding repayment.\n\n\n\n\n{1002-6-b-7-Interp}  \nOfficial Interpretation to 6(b)(7)\n\n\n\n\n\n Paragraph 6(b)(7).\n\n\n\n1. National origin\u2014immigration status. The applicant's immigration status and ties to the community (such as employment and continued residence in the area) could have a bearing on a creditor's ability to obtain repayment. Accordingly, the creditor may consider immigration status and differentiate, for example, between a noncitizen who is a long-time resident with permanent resident status and a noncitizen who is temporarily in this country on a student visa.\n\n\n\n\n\n2. National origin\u2014citizenship. A denial of credit on the ground that an applicant is not a United States citizen is not per se discrimination based on national origin.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee this interpretation in Supplement I\n\n\n\n(8) Marital status. Except as otherwise permitted or required by law, a creditor shall evaluate married and unmarried applicants by the same standards; and in evaluating joint applicants, a creditor shall not treat applicants differently based on the existence, absence, or likelihood of a marital relationship between the parties.\n\n\n\n\n{1002-6-b-8-Interp}  \nOfficial Interpretation to 6(b)(8)\n\n\n\n\n\n Paragraph 6(b)(8).\n\n\n\n1. Prohibited basis\u2014marital status. A creditor may consider the marital status of an applicant or joint applicant for the purpose of ascertaining the creditor's rights and remedies applicable to the particular extension of credit. For example, in a secured transaction involving real property, a creditor could take into account whether state law gives the applicant's spouse an interest in the property being offered as collateral.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee this interpretation in Supplement I\n\n\n\n(9) Race, color, religion, national origin, sex. Except as otherwise permitted or required by law, a creditor shall not consider race, color, religion, national origin, or sex (or an applicant's or other person's decision not to provide the information) in any aspect of a credit transaction.\n\n{1002-6-b-1}  \n(1) Except as provided in the Act and this part, a creditor shall not take a prohibited basis into account in any system of evaluating the creditworthiness of applicants.\n\n\n\n\n{1002-6-b-1-Interp}  \nOfficial Interpretation to 6(b)(1)\n\n\n\n\n\n Paragraph 6(b)(1).\n\n\n\n1. Prohibited basis \u2014special purpose credit. In a special purpose credit program, a creditor may consider a prohibited basis to determine whether the applicant possesses a characteristic needed for eligibility. (See \u00a7\u00a01002.8.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee this interpretation in Supplement I\n\n{1002-6-b-2}  \n(2) Age, receipt of public assistance.\n\n\n\n\n(i) Except as permitted in this paragraph, a creditor shall not take into account an applicant's age (provided that the applicant has the capacity to enter into a binding contract) or whether an applicant's income derives from any public assistance program.\n\n\n\n\n\n(ii) In an empirically derived, demonstrably and statistically sound, credit scoring system, a creditor may use an applicant's age as a predictive variable, provided that the age of an elderly applicant is not assigned a negative factor or value.\n\n\n\n\n\n(iii) In a judgmental system of evaluating creditworthiness, a creditor may consider an applicant's age or whether an applicant's income derives from any public assistance program only for the purpose of determining a pertinent element of creditworthiness.\n\n\n\n\n\n(iv) In any system of evaluating creditworthiness, a creditor may consider the age of an elderly applicant when such age is used to favor the elderly applicant in extending credit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{1002-6-b-2-Interp}  \nOfficial Interpretation to 6(b)(2)\n\n\n\n\n\n Paragraph 6(b)(2).\n\n\n\n1. Favoring the elderly. Any system of evaluating creditworthiness may favor a credit applicant who is age 62 or older. A credit program that offers more favorable credit terms to applicants age 62 or older is also permissible; a program that offers more favorable credit terms to applicants at an age lower than 62 is permissible only if it meets the special-purpose credit requirements of \u00a7\u00a01002.8.\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Consideration of age in a credit scoring system. Age may be taken directly into account in a credit scoring system that is \u201cdemonstrably and statistically sound,\u201d as defined in \u00a7\u00a01002.2(p), with one limitation: Applicants age 62 years or older must be treated at least as favorably as applicants who are under age 62. If age is scored by assigning points to an applicant's age category, elderly applicants must receive the same or a greater number of points as the most favored class of nonelderly applicants.\n\n\n\n\n\ni. Age-split scorecards. Some credit systems segment the population and use different scorecards based on the age of an applicant. In such a system, one card may cover a narrow age range (for example, applicants in their twenties or younger) who are evaluated under attributes predictive for that age group. A second card may cover all other applicants, who are evaluated under the attributes predictive for that broader class. When a system uses a card covering a wide age range that encompasses elderly applicants, the credit scoring system is not deemed to score age. Thus, the system does not raise the issue of assigning a negative factor or value to the age of elderly applicants. But if a system segments the population by age into multiple scorecards, and includes elderly applicants in a narrower age range, the credit scoring system does score age. To comply with the Act and regulation in such a case, the creditor must ensure that the system does not assign a negative factor or value to the age of elderly applicants as a class.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Consideration of age in a judgmental system. In a judgmental system, defined in \u00a7\u00a01002.2(t), a creditor may not decide whether to extend credit or set the terms and conditions of credit based on age or information related exclusively to age. Age or age-related information may be considered only in evaluating other \u201cpertinent elements of creditworthiness\u201d that are drawn from the particular facts and circumstances concerning the applicant. For example, a creditor may not reject an application or terminate an account because the applicant is 60 years old. But a creditor that uses a judgmental system may relate the applicant's age to other information about the applicant that the creditor considers in evaluating creditworthiness. As the following examples illustrate, the evaluation must be made in an individualized, case-by-case manner:\n\n\n\n\n\ni. A creditor may consider the applicant's occupation and length of time to retirement to ascertain whether the applicant's income (including retirement income) will support the extension of credit to its maturity.\n\n\n\n\n\nii. A creditor may consider the adequacy of any security offered when the term of the credit extension exceeds the life expectancy of the applicant and the cost of realizing on the collateral could exceed the applicant's equity. An elderly applicant might not qualify for a 5 percent down, 30-year mortgage loan but might qualify with a larger downpayment or a shorter loan maturity.\n\n\n\n\n\niii. A creditor may consider the applicant's age to assess the significance of length of employment (a young applicant may have just entered the job market) or length of time at an address (an elderly applicant may recently have retired and moved from a long-term residence).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4. Consideration of age in a reverse mortgage. A reverse mortgage is a home-secured loan in which the borrower receives payments from the creditor, and does not become obligated to repay these amounts (other than in the case of default) until the borrower dies, moves permanently from the home, or transfers title to the home, or upon a specified maturity date. Disbursements to the borrower under a reverse mortgage typically are determined by considering the value of the borrower's home, the current interest rate, and the borrower's life expectancy. A reverse mortgage program that requires borrowers to be age 62 or older is permissible under \u00a7\u00a01002.6(b)(2)(iv). In addition, under \u00a7\u00a01002.6(b)(2)(iii), a creditor may consider a borrower's age to evaluate a pertinent element of creditworthiness, such as the amount of the credit or monthly payments that the borrower will receive, or the estimated repayment date.\n\n\n\n\n\n5. Consideration of age in a combined system. A creditor using a credit scoring system that qualifies as \u201cempirically derived\u201d under \u00a7\u00a01002.2(p) may consider other factors (such as a credit report or the applicant's cash flow) on a judgmental basis. Doing so will not negate the classification of the credit scoring component of the combined system as \u201cdemonstrably and statistically sound.\u201d While age could be used in the credit scoring portion, however, in the judgmental portion age may not be considered directly. It may be used only for the purpose of determining a \u201cpertinent element of creditworthiness.\u201d (See comment 6(b)(2)-3.)\n\n\n\n\n\n6. Consideration of public assistance. When considering income derived from a public assistance program, a creditor may take into account, for example:\n\n\n\n\n\ni. The length of time an applicant will likely remain eligible to receive such income.\n\n\n\n\n\nii. Whether the applicant will continue to qualify for benefits based on the status of the applicant's dependents (as in the case of Temporary Aid to Needy Families, or social security payments to a minor).\n\n\n\n\n\niii. Whether the creditor can attach or garnish the income to assure payment of the debt in the event of default.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee this interpretation in Supplement I\n\n{1002-6-b-2-i}  \n(i) Except as permitted in this paragraph, a creditor shall not take into account an applicant's age (provided that the applicant has the capacity to enter into a binding contract) or whether an applicant's income derives from any public assistance program.\n\n{1002-6-b-2-ii}  \n(ii) In an empirically derived, demonstrably and statistically sound, credit scoring system, a creditor may use an applicant's age as a predictive variable, provided that the age of an elderly applicant is not assigned a negative factor or value.\n\n{1002-6-b-2-iii}  \n(iii) In a judgmental system of evaluating creditworthiness, a creditor may consider an applicant's age or whether an applicant's income derives from any public assistance program only for the purpose of determining a pertinent element of creditworthiness.\n\n{1002-6-b-2-iv}  \n(iv) In any system of evaluating creditworthiness, a creditor may consider the age of an elderly applicant when such age is used to favor the elderly applicant in extending credit.\n\n{1002-6-b-3}  \n(3) Childbearing, childrearing. In evaluating creditworthiness, a creditor shall not make assumptions or use aggregate statistics relating to the likelihood that any category of persons will bear or rear children or will, for that reason, receive diminished or interrupted income in the future.\n\n{1002-6-b-4}  \n(4) Telephone listing. A creditor shall not take into account whether there is a telephone listing in the name of an applicant for consumer credit but may take into account whether there is a telephone in the applicant's residence.\n\n{1002-6-b-5}  \n(5) Income. A creditor shall not discount or exclude from consideration the income of an applicant or the spouse of an applicant because of a prohibited basis or because the income is derived from part-time employment or is an annuity, pension, or other retirement benefit; a creditor may consider the amount and probable continuance of any income in evaluating an applicant's creditworthiness. When an applicant relies on alimony, child support, or separate maintenance payments in applying for credit, the creditor shall consider such payments as income to the extent that they are likely to be consistently made.\n\n\n\n\n{1002-6-b-5-Interp}  \nOfficial Interpretation to 6(b)(5)\n\n\n\n\n\n Paragraph 6(b)(5).\n\n\n\n1. Consideration of an individual applicant. A creditor must evaluate income derived from part-time employment, alimony, child support, separate maintenance payments, retirement benefits, or public assistance on an individual basis, not on the basis of aggregate statistics; and must assess its reliability or unreliability by analyzing the applicant's actual circumstances, not by analyzing statistical measures derived from a group.\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Payments consistently made. In determining the likelihood of consistent payments of alimony, child support, or separate maintenance, a creditor may consider factors such as whether payments are received pursuant to a written agreement or court decree; the length of time that the payments have been received; whether the payments are regularly received by the applicant; the availability of court or other procedures to compel payment; and the creditworthiness of the payor, including the credit history of the payor when it is available to the creditor.\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Consideration of income.\n\n\n\n\ni. A creditor need not consider income at all in evaluating creditworthiness. If a creditor does consider income, there are several acceptable methods, whether in a credit scoring or a judgmental system:\n\n\n\n\n\nA. A creditor may score or take into account the total sum of all income stated by the applicant without taking steps to evaluate the income for reliability.\n\n\n\n\n\nB. A creditor may evaluate each component of the applicant's income, and then score or take into account income determined to be reliable separately from other income; or the creditor may disregard that portion of income that is not reliable when it aggregates reliable income.\n\n\n\n\n\nC. A creditor that does not evaluate all income components for reliability must treat as reliable any component of protected income that is not evaluated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nii. In considering the separate components of an applicant's income, the creditor may not automatically discount or exclude from consideration any protected income. Any discounting or exclusion must be based on the applicant's actual circumstances.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4. Part-time employment, sources of income. A creditor may score or take into account the fact that an applicant has more than one source of earned income\u2014a full-time and a part-time job or two part-time jobs. A creditor may also score or treat earned income from a secondary source differently than earned income from a primary source. The creditor may not, however, score or otherwise take into account the number of sources for income such as retirement income, social security, supplemental security income, and alimony. Nor may the creditor treat negatively the fact that an applicant's only earned income is derived from, for example, a part-time job.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee this interpretation in Supplement I\n\n{1002-6-b-6}  \n(6) Credit history. To the extent that a creditor considers credit history in evaluating the creditworthiness of similarly qualified applicants for a similar type and amount of credit, in evaluating an applicant's creditworthiness a creditor shall consider:\n\n\n\n\n\n(i) The credit history, when available, of accounts designated as accounts that the applicant and the applicant's spouse are permitted to use or for which both are contractually liable;\n\n\n\n\n\n(ii) On the applicant's request, any information the applicant may present that tends to indicate the credit history being considered by the creditor does not accurately reflect the applicant's creditworthiness; and\n\n\n\n\n\n(iii) On the applicant's request, the credit history, when available, of any account reported in the name of the applicant's spouse or former spouse that the applicant can demonstrate accurately reflects the applicant's creditworthiness.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{1002-6-b-6-Interp}  \nOfficial Interpretation to 6(b)(6)\n\n\n\n\n\n Paragraph 6(b)(6).\n\n\n\n1. Types of credit references. A creditor may restrict the types of credit history and credit references that it will consider, provided that the restrictions are applied to all credit applicants without regard to sex, marital status, or any other prohibited basis. On the applicant's request, however, a creditor must consider credit information not reported through a credit bureau when the information relates to the same types of credit references and history that the creditor would consider if reported through a credit bureau.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee this interpretation in Supplement I\n\n{1002-6-b-6-i}  \n(i) The credit history, when available, of accounts designated as accounts that the applicant and the applicant's spouse are permitted to use or for which both are contractually liable;\n\n{1002-6-b-6-ii}  \n(ii) On the applicant's request, any information the applicant may present that tends to indicate the credit history being considered by the creditor does not accurately reflect the applicant's creditworthiness; and\n\n{1002-6-b-6-iii}  \n(iii) On the applicant's request, the credit history, when available, of any account reported in the name of the applicant's spouse or former spouse that the applicant can demonstrate accurately reflects the applicant's creditworthiness.\n\n{1002-6-b-7}  \n(7) Immigration status. A creditor may consider the applicant's immigration status or status as a permanent resident of the United States, and any additional information that may be necessary to ascertain the creditor's rights and remedies regarding repayment.\n\n\n\n\n{1002-6-b-7-Interp}  \nOfficial Interpretation to 6(b)(7)\n\n\n\n\n\n Paragraph 6(b)(7).\n\n\n\n1. National origin\u2014immigration status. The applicant's immigration status and ties to the community (such as employment and continued residence in the area) could have a bearing on a creditor's ability to obtain repayment. Accordingly, the creditor may consider immigration status and differentiate, for example, between a noncitizen who is a long-time resident with permanent resident status and a noncitizen who is temporarily in this country on a student visa.\n\n\n\n\n\n2. National origin\u2014citizenship. A denial of credit on the ground that an applicant is not a United States citizen is not per se discrimination based on national origin.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee this interpretation in Supplement I\n\n{1002-6-b-8}  \n(8) Marital status. Except as otherwise permitted or required by law, a creditor shall evaluate married and unmarried applicants by the same standards; and in evaluating joint applicants, a creditor shall not treat applicants differently based on the existence, absence, or likelihood of a marital relationship between the parties.\n\n\n\n\n{1002-6-b-8-Interp}  \nOfficial Interpretation to 6(b)(8)\n\n\n\n\n\n Paragraph 6(b)(8).\n\n\n\n1. Prohibited basis\u2014marital status. A creditor may consider the marital status of an applicant or joint applicant for the purpose of ascertaining the creditor's rights and remedies applicable to the particular extension of credit. For example, in a secured transaction involving real property, a creditor could take into account whether state law gives the applicant's spouse an interest in the property being offered as collateral.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee this interpretation in Supplement I\n\n{1002-6-b-9}  \n(9) Race, color, religion, national origin, sex. Except as otherwise permitted or required by law, a creditor shall not consider race, color, religion, national origin, or sex (or an applicant's or other person's decision not to provide the information) in any aspect of a credit transaction.\n\n{1002-6-c}  \n(c) State property laws. A creditor's consideration or application of state property laws directly or indirectly affecting creditworthiness does not constitute unlawful discrimination for the purposes of the Act or this part.\n{afc3127caf516fda3f38744156e330073fd28b3c58527fd6258905fb}  \nPrevious section - \u00a7\u00a01002.5  Rules concerning requests for information.\n{e5f285a3e2bc8111cda9c64cd31475fb17a6199f89bf809b6fb514dc}  \nNext section - \u00a7\u00a01002.7 Rules concerning extensions of credit.",

A creditor shall not refuse to grant an individual account to a creditworthy applicant on the basis of sex, marital status, or any other prohibited basis.\n\n\n\n\n{1002-7-a-Interp}  \nOfficial Interpretation to 7(a)\n\n\n\n\n\n 7(a) Individual accounts.\n\n\n\n1. Open-end credit\u2014authorized user. A creditor may not require a creditworthy applicant seeking an individual credit account to provide additional signatures. But the creditor may condition the designation of an authorized user by the account holder on the authorized user's becoming contractually liable for the account, as long as the creditor does not differentiate on any prohibited basis in imposing this requirement.\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Open-end credit\u2014choice of authorized user. A creditor that permits an account holder to designate an authorized user may not restrict this designation on a prohibited basis. For example, if the creditor allows the designation of spouses as authorized users, the creditor may not refuse to accept a non-spouse as an authorized user.\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Overdraft authority on transaction accounts. If a transaction account (such as a checking account or NOW account) includes an overdraft line of credit, the creditor may require that all persons authorized to draw on the transaction account assume liability for any overdraft.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee this interpretation in Supplement I\n\n{1002-7-b}  \n(b) Designation of name. A creditor shall not refuse to allow an applicant to open or maintain an account in a birth-given first name and a surname that is the applicant's birth-given surname, the spouse's surname, or a combined surname.\n\n\n\n\n{1002-7-b-Interp}  \nOfficial Interpretation to 7(b)\n\n\n\n\n\n 7(b) Designation of name.\n\n\n\n1. Single name on account. A creditor may require that joint applicants on an account designate a single name for purposes of administering the account and that a single name be embossed on any credit cards issued on the account. But the creditor may not require that the name be the husband's name. (See \u00a7\u00a01002.10 for rules governing the furnishing of credit history on accounts held by spouses.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee this interpretation in Supplement I\n\n{1002-7-c}  \n(c) Action concerning existing open-end accounts \u2014\n\n\n\n\n\n(1) Limitations. In the absence of evidence of the applicant's inability or unwillingness to repay, a creditor shall not take any of the following actions regarding an applicant who is contractually liable on an existing open-end account on the basis of the applicant's reaching a certain age or retiring or on the basis of a change in the applicant's name or marital status:\n\n\n\n\n\n(i) Require a reapplication, except as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section;\n\n\n\n\n\n(ii) Change the terms of the account; or\n\n\n\n\n\n(iii) Terminate the account.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{1002-7-c-1-Interp}  \nOfficial Interpretation to 7(c)(1)\n\n\n\n\n\n Paragraph 7(c)(1).\n\n\n\n1. Termination coincidental with marital status change. When an account holder's marital status changes, a creditor generally may not terminate the account unless it has evidence that the account holder is now unable or unwilling to repay. But the creditor may terminate an account on which both spouses are jointly liable, even if the action coincides with a change in marital status, when one or both spouses:\n\n\n\n\n\ni. Repudiate responsibility for future charges on the joint account.\n\n\n\n\n\nii. Request separate accounts in their own names.\n\n\n\n\n\niii. Request that the joint account be closed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Updating information. A creditor may periodically request updated information from applicants but may not use events related to a prohibited basis\u2014such as an applicant's retirement or reaching a particular age, or a change in name or marital status\u2014to trigger such a request.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee this interpretation in Supplement I\n\n\n\n(2) Requiring reapplication. A creditor may require a reapplication for an open-end account on the basis of a change in the marital status of an applicant who is contractually liable if the credit granted was based in whole or in part on income of the applicant's spouse and if information available to the creditor indicates that the applicant's income may not support the amount of credit currently available.\n\n\n\n\n{1002-7-c-2-Interp}  \nOfficial Interpretation to 7(c)(2)\n\n\n\n\n\n Paragraph 7(c)(2).\n\n\n\n1. Procedure pending reapplication. A creditor may require a reapplication from an account holder, even when there is no evidence of unwillingness or inability to repay, if (1) the credit was based on the qualifications of a person who is no longer available to support the credit and (2) the creditor has information indicating that the account holder's income may be insufficient to support the credit. While a reapplication is pending, the creditor must allow the account holder full access to the account under the existing contract terms. The creditor may specify a reasonable time period within which the account holder must submit the required information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee this interpretation in Supplement I\n\n{1002-7-c-1}  \n(1) Limitations. In the absence of evidence of the applicant's inability or unwillingness to repay, a creditor shall not take any of the following actions regarding an applicant who is contractually liable on an existing open-end account on the basis of the applicant's reaching a certain age or retiring or on the basis of a change in the applicant's name or marital status:\n\n\n\n\n\n(i) Require a reapplication, except as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section;\n\n\n\n\n\n(ii) Change the terms of the account; or\n\n\n\n\n\n(iii) Terminate the account.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{1002-7-c-1-Interp}  \nOfficial Interpretation to 7(c)(1)\n\n\n\n\n\n Paragraph 7(c)(1).\n\n\n\n1.

A creditor may require a reapplication for an open-end account on the basis of a change in the marital status of an applicant who is contractually liable if the credit granted was based in whole or in part on income of the applicant's spouse and if information available to the creditor indicates that the applicant's income may not support the amount of credit currently available.\n\n\n\n\n{1002-7-c-2-Interp}  \nOfficial Interpretation to 7(c)(2)\n\n\n\n\n\n Paragraph 7(c)(2).\n\n\n\n1. Procedure pending reapplication. A creditor may require a reapplication from an account holder, even when there is no evidence of unwillingness or inability to repay, if (1) the credit was based on the qualifications of a person who is no longer available to support the credit and (2) the creditor has information indicating that the account holder's income may be insufficient to support the credit. While a reapplication is pending, the creditor must allow the account holder full access to the account under the existing contract terms. The creditor may specify a reasonable time period within which the account holder must submit the required information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee this interpretation in Supplement I\n\n{1002-7-d}  \n(d) Signature of spouse or other person \u2014\n\n\n\n\n\n(1) Rule for qualified applicant. Except as provided in this paragraph, a creditor shall not require the signature of an applicant's spouse or other person, other than a joint applicant, on any credit instrument if the applicant qualifies under the creditor's standards of creditworthiness for the amount and terms of the credit requested. A creditor shall not deem the submission of a joint financial statement or other evidence of jointly held assets as an application for joint credit.\n\n\n\n\n{1002-7-d-1-Interp}  \nOfficial Interpretation to 7(d)(1)\n\n\n\n\n\n Paragraph 7(d)(1).\n\n\n\n1. Signature of another person. It is impermissible for a creditor to require an applicant who is individually creditworthy to provide a cosigner-even if the creditor applies the requirement without regard to sex, marital status, or any other prohibited basis. (But see comment 7(d)(6)-1 concerning guarantors of closely held corporations.)\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Joint applicant. The term \u201cjoint applicant\u201d refers to someone who applies contemporaneously with the applicant for shared or joint credit. It does not refer to someone whose signature is required by the creditor as a condition for granting the credit requested.\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Evidence of joint application. A person's intent to be a joint applicant must be evidenced at the time of application. Signatures on a promissory note may not be used to show intent to apply for joint credit. On the other hand, signatures or initials on a credit application affirming applicants' intent to apply for joint credit may be used to establish intent to apply for joint credit. (See Appendix B.) The method used to establish intent must be distinct from the means used by individuals to affirm the accuracy of information. For example, signatures on a joint financial statement affirming the veracity of information are not sufficient to establish intent to apply for joint credit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee this interpretation in Supplement I\n\n\n\n(2) Unsecured credit. If an applicant requests unsecured credit and relies in part upon property that the applicant owns jointly with another person to satisfy the creditor's standards of creditworthiness, the creditor may require the signature of the other person only on the instrument(s) necessary, or reasonably believed by the creditor to be necessary, under the law of the state in which the property is located, to enable the creditor to reach the property being relied upon in the event of the death or default of the applicant.\n\n\n\n\n{1002-7-d-2-Interp}  \nOfficial Interpretation to 7(d)(2)\n\n\n\n\n\n Paragraph 7(d)(2).\n\n\n\n1. Jointly owned property. If an applicant requests unsecured credit, does not own sufficient separate property, and relies on joint property to establish creditworthiness, the creditor must value the applicant's interest in the jointly owned property. A creditor may not request that a nonapplicant joint owner sign any instrument as a condition of the credit extension unless the applicant's interest does not support the amount and terms of the credit sought.\n\n\n\n\n\ni. Valuation of applicant's interest. In determining the value of an applicant's interest in jointly owned property, a creditor may consider factors such as the form of ownership and the property's susceptibility to attachment, execution, severance, or partition; the value of the applicant's interest after such action; and the cost associated with the action. This determination must be based on the existing form of ownership, and not on the possibility of a subsequent change. For example, in determining whether a married applicant's interest in jointly owned property is sufficient to satisfy the creditor's standards of creditworthiness for individual credit, a creditor may not consider that the applicant's separate property could be transferred into tenancy by the entirety after consummation. Similarly, a creditor may not consider the possibility that the couple may divorce. Accordingly, a creditor may not require the signature of the non-applicant spouse in these or similar circumstances.\n\n\n\n\n\nii. Other options to support credit. If the applicant's interest in jointly owned property does not support the amount and terms of credit sought, the creditor may offer the applicant other options to qualify for the extension of credit. For example:\n\n\n\n\n\nA. Providing a co-signer or other party (\u00a7\u00a01002.7(d)(5));\n\n\n\n\n\nB. Requesting that the credit be granted on a secured basis (\u00a7\u00a01002.7(d)(4)); or\n\n\n\n\n\nC. Providing the signature of the joint owner on an instrument that ensures access to the property in the event of the applicant's death or default, but does not impose personal liability unless necessary under state law (such as a limited guarantee). A creditor may not routinely require, however, that a joint owner sign an instrument (such as a quitclaim deed) that would result in the forfeiture of the joint owner's interest in the property.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Need for signature\u2014reasonable belief. A creditor's reasonable belief as to what instruments need to be signed by a person other than the applicant should be supported by a thorough review of pertinent statutory and decisional law or an opinion of the state attorney general.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee this interpretation in Supplement I\n\n\n\n(3) Unsecured credit\u2014community property states. If a married applicant requests unsecured credit and resides in a community property state, or if the applicant is relying on property located in such a state, a creditor may require the signature of the spouse on any instrument necessary, or reasonably believed by the creditor to be necessary, under applicable state law to make the community property available to satisfy the debt in the event of default if:\n\n\n\n\n\n(i) Applicable state law denies the applicant power to manage or control sufficient community property to qualify for the credit requested under the creditor's standards of creditworthiness; and\n\n\n\n\n\n(ii) The applicant does not have sufficient separate property to qualify for the credit requested without regard to community property.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{1002-7-d-3-Interp}  \nOfficial Interpretation to 7(d)(3)\n\n\n\n\n\n Paragraph 7(d)(3).\n\n\n\n1. Residency. In assessing the creditworthiness of a person who applies for credit in a community property state, a creditor may assume that the applicant is a resident of the state unless the applicant indicates otherwise.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee this interpretation in Supplement I\n\n\n\n(4) Secured credit. If an applicant requests secured credit, a creditor may require the signature of the applicant's spouse or other person on any instrument necessary, or reasonably believed by the creditor to be necessary, under applicable state law to make the property being offered as security available to satisfy the debt in the event of default, for example, an instrument to create a valid lien, pass clear title, waive inchoate rights, or assign earnings.\n\n\n\n\n{1002-7-d-4-Interp}  \nOfficial Interpretation to 7(d)(4)\n\n\n\n\n\n Paragraph 7(d)(4).\n\n\n\n1. Creation of enforceable lien. Some state laws require that both spouses join in executing any instrument by which real property is encumbered. If an applicant offers such property as security for credit, a creditor may require the applicant's spouse to sign the instruments necessary to create a valid security interest in the property. The creditor may not require the spouse to sign the note evidencing the credit obligation if signing only the mortgage or other security agreement is sufficient to make the property available to satisfy the debt in the event of default. However, if under state law both spouses must sign the note to create an enforceable lien, the creditor may require the signatures.\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Need for signature\u2014reasonable belief. Generally, a signature to make the secured property available will only be needed on a security agreement. A creditor's reasonable belief that, to ensure access to the property, the spouse's signature is needed on an instrument that imposes personal liability should be supported by a thorough review of pertinent statutory and decisional law or an opinion of the state attorney general.\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Integrated instruments. When a creditor uses an integrated instrument that combines the note and the security agreement, the spouse cannot be asked to sign the integrated instrument if the signature is only needed to grant a security interest. But the spouse could be asked to sign an integrated instrument that makes clear\u2014for example, by a legend placed next to the spouse's signature\u2014that the spouse's signature is only to grant a security interest and that signing the instrument does not impose personal liability.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee this interpretation in Supplement I\n\n\n\n(5) Additional parties. If, under a creditor's standards of creditworthiness, the personal liability of an additional party is necessary to support the credit requested, a creditor may request a cosigner, guarantor, endorser, or similar party. The applicant's spouse may serve as an additional party, but the creditor shall not require that the spouse be the additional party.\n\n\n\n\n{1002-7-d-5-Interp}  \nOfficial Interpretation to 7(d)(5)\n\n\n\n\n\n Paragraph 7(d)(5).\n\n\n\n1. Qualifications of additional parties. In establishing guidelines for eligibility of guarantors, cosigners, or similar additional parties, a creditor may restrict the applicant's choice of additional parties but may not discriminate on the basis of sex, marital status, or any other prohibited basis. For example, the creditor could require that the additional party live in the creditor's market area.\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Reliance on income of another person \u2014 individual credit. An applicant who requests individual credit relying on the income of another person (including a spouse in a non-community property state) may be required to provide the signature of the other person to make the income available to pay the debt. In community property states, the signature of a spouse may be required if the applicant relies on the spouse's separate income. If the applicant relies on the spouse's future earnings that as a matter of state law cannot be characterized as community property until earned, the creditor may require the spouse's signature, but need not do so\u2014even if it is the creditor's practice to require the signature when an applicant relies on the future earnings of a person other than a spouse. (See \u00a7\u00a01002.6(c) on consideration of state property laws.)\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Renewals. If the borrower's creditworthiness is reevaluated when a credit obligation is renewed, the creditor must determine whether an additional party is still warranted and, if not warranted, release the additional party.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee this interpretation in Supplement I\n\n\n\n(6) Rights of additional parties. A creditor shall not impose requirements upon an additional party that the creditor is prohibited from imposing upon an applicant under this section.\n\n\n\n\n{1002-7-d-6-Interp}  \nOfficial Interpretation to 7(d)(6)\n\n\n\n\n\n Paragraph 7(d)(6).\n\n\n\n1. Guarantees. A guarantee on an extension of credit is part of a credit transaction and therefore subject to the regulation. A creditor may require the personal guarantee of the partners, directors, or officers of a business, and the shareholders of a closely held corporation, even if the business or corporation is creditworthy. The requirement must be based on the guarantor's relationship with the business or corporation, however, and not on a prohibited basis. For example, a creditor may not require guarantees only for women-owned or minority-owned businesses. Similarly, a creditor may not require guarantees only of the married officers of a business or the married shareholders of a closely held corporation.\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Spousal guarantees. The rules in \u00a7\u00a01002.7(d) bar a creditor from requiring the signature of a guarantor's spouse just as they bar the creditor from requiring the signature of an applicant's spouse. For example, although a creditor may require all officers of a closely held corporation to personally guarantee a corporate loan, the creditor may not automatically require that spouses of married officers also sign the guarantee. If an evaluation of the financial circumstances of an officer indicates that an additional signature is necessary, however, the creditor may require the signature of another person in appropriate circumstances in accordance with \u00a7\u00a01002.7(d)(2).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee this interpretation in Supplement I\n\n\n\n\n{1002-7-d-Interp}  \nOfficial Interpretation to 7(d)\n\n\n\n\n\n 7(d) Signature of spouse or other person.\n\n\n\n1. Qualified applicant. The signature rules ensure that qualified applicants are able to obtain credit in their own names. Thus, when an applicant requests individual credit, a creditor generally may not require the signature of another person unless the creditor has first determined that the applicant alone does not qualify for the credit requested.\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Unqualified applicant. When an applicant requests individual credit but does not meet a creditor's standards, the creditor may require a cosigner, guarantor, endorser, or similar party\u2014but cannot require that it be the spouse. (See commentary to \u00a7\u00a7\u00a01002.7(d)(5) and (6).)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee this interpretation in Supplement I\n\n{1002-7-d-1}  \n(1) Rule for qualified applicant. Except as provided in this paragraph, a creditor shall not require the signature of an applicant's spouse or other person, other than a joint applicant, on any credit instrument if the applicant qualifies under the creditor's standards of creditworthiness for the amount and terms of the credit requested. A creditor shall not deem the submission of a joint financial statement or other evidence of jointly held assets as an application for joint credit.\n\n\n\n\n{1002-7-d-1-Interp}  \nOfficial Interpretation to 7(d)(1)\n\n\n\n\n\n Paragraph 7(d)(1).\n\n\n\n1.

If a married applicant requests unsecured credit and resides in a community property state, or if the applicant is relying on property located in such a state, a creditor may require the signature of the spouse on any instrument necessary, or reasonably believed by the creditor to be necessary, under applicable state law to make the community property available to satisfy the debt in the event of default if:\n\n\n\n\n\n(i) Applicable state law denies the applicant power to manage or control sufficient community property to qualify for the credit requested under the creditor's standards of creditworthiness; and\n\n\n\n\n\n(ii) The applicant does not have sufficient separate property to qualify for the credit requested without regard to community property.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{1002-7-d-3-Interp}  \nOfficial Interpretation to 7(d)(3)\n\n\n\n\n\n Paragraph 7(d)(3).\n\n\n\n1.

Subject to the provisions of paragraph (b) of this section, the Act and this part permit a creditor to extend special purpose credit to applicants who meet eligibility requirements under the following types of credit programs:\n\n\n\n\n\n(1) Any credit assistance program expressly authorized by Federal or state law for the benefit of an economically disadvantaged class of persons;\n\n\n\n\n\n(2) Any credit assistance program offered by a not-for-profit organization, as defined under section 501(c) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, as amended, for the benefit of its members or for the benefit of an economically disadvantaged class of persons; or\n\n\n\n\n\n(3) Any special purpose credit program offered by a for-profit organization, or in which such an organization participates to meet special social needs, if:\n\n\n\n\n\n(i) The program is established and administered pursuant to a written plan that identifies the class of persons that the program is designed to benefit and sets forth the procedures and standards for extending credit pursuant to the program; and\n\n\n\n\n\n(ii) The program is established and administered to extend credit to a class of persons who, under the organization's customary standards of creditworthiness, probably would not receive such credit or would receive it on less favorable terms than are ordinarily available to other applicants applying to the organization for a similar type and amount of credit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{1002-8-a-Interp}  \nOfficial Interpretation to 8(a)\n\n\n\n\n\n 8(a) Standards for programs.\n\n\n\n1. Determining qualified programs. The Bureau does not determine whether individual programs qualify for special purpose credit status, or whether a particular program benefits an \u201ceconomically disadvantaged class of persons.\u201d The agency or creditor administering or offering the loan program must make these decisions regarding the status of its program.\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Compliance with a program authorized by Federal or state law. A creditor does not violate Regulation B when it complies in good faith with a regulation promulgated by a government agency implementing a special purpose credit program under \u00a7\u00a01002.8(a)(1). It is the agency's responsibility to promulgate a regulation that is consistent with Federal and state law.\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Expressly authorized. Credit programs authorized by Federal or state law include programs offered pursuant to Federal, state, or local statute, regulation or ordinance, or pursuant to judicial or administrative order.\n\n\n\n\n\n4. Creditor liability. A refusal to grant credit to an applicant is not a violation of the Act or regulation if the applicant does not meet the eligibility requirements under a special purpose credit program.\n\n\n\n\n\n5. Determining need. In designing a special purpose credit program under \u00a7\u00a01002.8(a), a for-profit organization must determine that the program will benefit a class of people who would otherwise be denied credit or would receive it on less favorable terms. This determination can be based on a broad analysis using the organization's own research or data from outside sources, including governmental reports and studies. For example, a creditor might design new products to reach consumers who would not meet, or have not met, its traditional standards of creditworthiness due to such factors as credit inexperience or the use of credit sources that may not report to consumer reporting agencies. Or, a bank could review Home Mortgage Disclosure Act data along with demographic data for its assessment area and conclude that there is a need for a special purpose credit program for low-income minority borrowers.\n\n\n\n\n\n6. Elements of the program. The written plan must contain information that supports the need for the particular program. The plan also must either state a specific period of time for which the program will last, or contain a statement regarding when the program will be reevaluated to determine if there is a continuing need for it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee this interpretation in Supplement I\n\n{1002-8-a-1}  \n(1) Any credit assistance program expressly authorized by Federal or state law for the benefit of an economically disadvantaged class of persons;\n\n{1002-8-a-2}  \n(2) Any credit assistance program offered by a not-for-profit organization, as defined under section 501(c) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, as amended, for the benefit of its members or for the benefit of an economically disadvantaged class of persons; or\n\n{1002-8-a-3}  \n(3) Any special purpose credit program offered by a for-profit organization, or in which such an organization participates to meet special social needs, if:\n\n\n\n\n\n(i) The program is established and administered pursuant to a written plan that identifies the class of persons that the program is designed to benefit and sets forth the procedures and standards for extending credit pursuant to the program; and\n\n\n\n\n\n(ii) The program is established and administered to extend credit to a class of persons who, under the organization's customary standards of creditworthiness, probably would not receive such credit or would receive it on less favorable terms than are ordinarily available to other applicants applying to the organization for a similar type and amount of credit.\n\n{1002-8-a-3-i}  \n(i) The program is established and administered pursuant to a written plan that identifies the class of persons that the program is designed to benefit and sets forth the procedures and standards for extending credit pursuant to the program; and\n\n{1002-8-a-3-ii}  \n(ii) The program is established and administered to extend credit to a class of persons who, under the organization's customary standards of creditworthiness, probably would not receive such credit or would receive it on less favorable terms than are ordinarily available to other applicants applying to the organization for a similar type and amount of credit.\n\n{1002-8-b}  \n(b) Rules in other sections \u2014\n\n\n\n\n\n(1) General applicability. All the provisions of this part apply to each of the special purpose credit programs described in paragraph (a) of this section except as modified by this section.\n\n\n\n\n\n(2) Common characteristics. A program described in paragraph (a)(2) or (a)(3) of this section qualifies as a special purpose credit program only if it was established and is administered so as not to discriminate against an applicant on any prohibited basis; however, all program participants may be required to share one or more common characteristics (for example, race, national origin, or sex) so long as the program was not established and is not administered with the purpose of evading the requirements of the Act or this part.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{1002-8-b-Interp}  \nOfficial Interpretation to 8(b)\n\n\n\n\n\n 8(b) Rules in other sections.\n\n\n\n1. Applicability of rules. A creditor that rejects an application because the applicant does not meet the eligibility requirements (common characteristic or financial need, for example) must nevertheless notify the applicant of action taken as required by \u00a7\u00a01002.9.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee this interpretation in Supplement I\n\n{1002-8-b-1}  \n(1) General applicability. All the provisions of this part apply to each of the special purpose credit programs described in paragraph (a) of this section except as modified by this section.\n\n{1002-8-b-2}  \n(2) Common characteristics. A program described in paragraph (a)(2) or (a)(3) of this section qualifies as a special purpose credit program only if it was established and is administered so as not to discriminate against an applicant on any prohibited basis; however, all program participants may be required to share one or more common characteristics (for example, race, national origin, or sex) so long as the program was not established and is not administered with the purpose of evading the requirements of the Act or this part.\n\n{1002-8-c}  \n(c) Special rule concerning requests and use of information. If participants in a special purpose credit program described in paragraph (a) of this section are required to possess one or more common characteristics (for example, race, national origin, or sex) and if the program otherwise satisfies the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section, a creditor may request and consider information regarding the common characteristic(s) in determining the applicant's eligibility for the program.\n\n\n\n\n{1002-8-c-Interp}  \nOfficial Interpretation to 8(c)\n\n\n\n\n\n 8(c) Special rule concerning requests and use of information.\n\n\n\n1. Request of prohibited basis information. This section permits a creditor to request and consider certain information that would otherwise be prohibited by \u00a7\u00a7\u00a01002.5 and 1002.6 to determine an applicant's eligibility for a particular program.\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Examples. Examples of programs under which the creditor can ask for and consider information about a prohibited basis are:\n\n\n\n\n\ni. Energy conservation programs to assist the elderly, for which the creditor must consider the applicant's age.\n\n\n\n\n\nii. Programs under a Minority Enterprise Small Business Investment Corporation, for which a creditor must consider the applicant's minority status.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee this interpretation in Supplement I\n\n{1002-8-d}  \n(d) Special rule in the case of financial need. If financial need is one of the criteria under a special purpose credit program described in paragraph (a) of this section, the creditor may request and consider, in determining an applicant's eligibility for the program, information regarding the applicant's marital status; alimony, child support, and separate maintenance income; and the spouse's financial resources. In addition, a creditor may obtain the signature of an applicant's spouse or other person on an application or credit instrument relating to a special purpose credit program if the signature is required by Federal or state law.\n\n\n\n\n{1002-8-d-Interp}  \nOfficial Interpretation to 8(d)\n\n\n\n\n\n 8(d) Special rule in the case of financial need.\n\n\n\n1. Request of prohibited basis information. This section permits a creditor to request and consider certain information that would otherwise be prohibited by \u00a7\u00a7\u00a01002.5 and 1002.6, and to require signatures that would otherwise be prohibited by \u00a7\u00a01002.7(d).\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Examples. Examples of programs in which financial need is a criterion are:\n\n\n\n\n\ni. Subsidized housing programs for low-to moderate-income households, for which a creditor may have to consider the applicant's receipt of alimony or child support, the spouse's or parents' income, etc.\n\n\n\n\n\nii. Student loan programs based on the family's financial need, for which a creditor may have to consider the spouse's or parents' financial resources.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Student loans. In a guaranteed student loan program, a creditor may obtain the signature of a parent as a guarantor when required by Federal or state law or agency regulation, or when the student does not meet the creditor's standards of creditworthiness. (See \u00a7\u00a7\u00a01002.7(d)(1) and (5).) The creditor may not require an additional signature when a student has a work or credit history that satisfies the creditor's standards.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee this interpretation in Supplement I\n{7dc958f5b3231d0e93a9e80101379d8bc03cfc08f970cd805eeaad85}  \nPrevious section - \u00a7\u00a01002.7  Rules concerning extensions of credit.\n{3e02f88bd9c91893490bcd87881b21e95611fbc30e881bcb4d2f9e6b}  \nNext section - \u00a7\u00a01002.9 Notifications.",

A creditor shall notify an applicant of action taken within:\n\n\n\n\n\n(i) 30 days after receiving a completed application concerning the creditor's approval of, counteroffer to, or adverse action on the application;\n\n\n\n\n\n(ii) 30 days after taking adverse action on an incomplete application, unless notice is provided in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section;\n\n\n\n\n\n(iii) 30 days after taking adverse action on an existing account; or\n\n\n\n\n\n(iv) 90 days after notifying the applicant of a counteroffer if the applicant does not expressly accept or use the credit offered.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{1002-9-a-1-Interp}  \nOfficial Interpretation to 9(a)(1)\n\n\n\n\n\n Paragraph 9(a)(1).\n\n\n\n1. Timing of notice\u2014when an application is complete. Once a creditor has obtained all the information it normally considers in making a credit decision, the application is complete and the creditor has 30 days in which to notify the applicant of the credit decision. (See also comment 2(f)-6.)\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Notification of approval. Notification of approval may be express or by implication. For example, the creditor will satisfy the notification requirement when it gives the applicant the credit card, money, property, or services requested.\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Incomplete application\u2014denial for incompleteness. When an application is incomplete regarding information that the applicant can provide and the creditor lacks sufficient data for a credit decision, the creditor may deny the application giving as the reason for denial that the application is incomplete. The creditor has the option, alternatively, of providing a notice of incompleteness under \u00a7\u00a01002.9(c).\n\n\n\n\n\n4. Incomplete application\u2014denial for reasons other than incompleteness. When an application is missing information but provides sufficient data for a credit decision, the creditor may evaluate the application, make its credit decision, and notify the applicant accordingly. If credit is denied, the applicant must be given the specific reasons for the credit denial (or notice of the right to receive the reasons); in this instance missing information or \u201cincomplete application\u201d cannot be given as the reason for the denial.\n\n\n\n\n\n5. Length of counteroffer. Section 1002.9(a)(1)(iv) does not require a creditor to hold a counteroffer open for 90 days or any other particular length of time.\n\n\n\n\n\n6. Counteroffer combined with adverse action notice. A creditor that gives the applicant a combined counteroffer and adverse action notice that complies with \u00a7\u00a01002.9(a)(2) need not send a second adverse action notice if the applicant does not accept the counteroffer. A sample of a combined notice is contained in form C-4 of Appendix C to the regulation.\n\n\n\n\n\n7. Denial of a telephone application. When an application is made by telephone and adverse action is taken, the creditor must request the applicant's name and address in order to provide written notification under this section. If the applicant declines to provide that information, then the creditor has no further notification responsibility.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee this interpretation in Supplement I\n\n\n\n(2) Content of notification when adverse action is taken. A notification given to an applicant when adverse action is taken shall be in writing and shall contain a statement of the action taken; the name and address of the creditor; a statement of the provisions of section 701(a) of the Act; the name and address of the Federal agency that administers compliance with respect to the creditor; and either:\n\n\n\n\n\n(i) A statement of specific reasons for the action taken; or\n\n\n\n\n\n(ii) A disclosure of the applicant's right to a statement of specific reasons within 30 days, if the statement is requested within 60 days of the creditor's notification. The disclosure shall include the name, address, and telephone number of the person or office from which the statement of reasons can be obtained. If the creditor chooses to provide the reasons orally, the creditor shall also disclose the applicant's right to have them confirmed in writing within 30 days of receiving the applicant's written request for confirmation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(3) Notification to business credit applicants. For business credit, a creditor shall comply with the notification requirements of this section in the following manner:\n\n\n\n\n\n(i) With regard to a business that had gross revenues of $1 million or less in its preceding fiscal year (other than an extension of trade credit, credit incident to a factoring agreement, or other similar types of business credit), a creditor shall comply with paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section, except that:\n\n\n\n\n\n(A) The statement of the action taken may be given orally or in writing, when adverse action is taken;\n\n\n\n\n\n(B) Disclosure of an applicant's right to a statement of reasons may be given at the time of application, instead of when adverse action is taken, provided the disclosure contains the information required by paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section and the ECOA notice specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section;\n\n\n\n\n\n(C) For an application made entirely by telephone, a creditor satisfies the requirements of paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section by an oral statement of the action taken and of the applicant's right to a statement of reasons for adverse action.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(ii) With regard to a business that had gross revenues in excess of $1 million in its preceding fiscal year or an extension of trade credit, credit incident to a factoring agreement, or other similar types of business credit, a creditor shall:\n\n\n\n\n\n(A) Notify the applicant, within a reasonable time, orally or in writing, of the action taken; and\n\n\n\n\n\n(B) Provide a written statement of the reasons for adverse action and the ECOA notice specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section if the applicant makes a written request for the reasons within 60 days of the creditor's notification.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{1002-9-a-3-Interp}  \nOfficial Interpretation to 9(a)(3)\n\n\n\n\n\n Paragraph 9(a)(3).\n\n\n\n1. Coverage. In determining which rules in this paragraph apply to a given business credit application, a creditor may rely on the applicant's assertion about the revenue size of the business. (Applications to start a business are governed by the rules in \u00a7\u00a01002.9(a)(3)(i).) If an applicant applies for credit as a sole proprietor, the revenues of the sole proprietorship will determine which rules govern the application. However, if an applicant applies for business credit as an individual, the rules in \u00a7\u00a01002.9(a)(3)(i) apply unless the application is for trade or similar credit.\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Trade credit. The term trade credit generally is limited to a financing arrangement that involves a buyer and a seller\u2014such as a supplier who finances the sale of equipment, supplies, or inventory; it does not apply to an extension of credit by a bank or other financial institution for the financing of such items.\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Factoring. Factoring refers to a purchase of accounts receivable, and thus is not subject to the Act or regulation. If there is a credit extension incident to the factoring arrangement, the notification rules in \u00a7\u00a01002.9(a)(3)(ii) apply, as do other relevant sections of the Act and regulation.\n\n\n\n\n\n4. Manner of compliance. In complying with the notice provisions of the Act and regulation, creditors offering business credit may follow the rules governing consumer credit. Similarly, creditors may elect to treat all business credit the same (irrespective of revenue size) by providing notice in accordance with \u00a7\u00a01002.9(a)(3)(i).\n\n\n\n\n\n5. Timing of notification. A creditor subject to \u00a7\u00a01002.9(a)(3)(ii)(A) is required to notify a business credit applicant, orally or in writing, of action taken on an application within a reasonable time of receiving a completed application. Notice provided in accordance with the timing requirements of \u00a7\u00a01002.9(a)(1) is deemed reasonable in all instances.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee this interpretation in Supplement I\n\n{1002-9-a-1}  \n(1) When notification is required. A creditor shall notify an applicant of action taken within:\n\n\n\n\n\n(i) 30 days after receiving a completed application concerning the creditor's approval of, counteroffer to, or adverse action on the application;\n\n\n\n\n\n(ii) 30 days after taking adverse action on an incomplete application, unless notice is provided in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section;\n\n\n\n\n\n(iii) 30 days after taking adverse action on an existing account; or\n\n\n\n\n\n(iv) 90 days after notifying the applicant of a counteroffer if the applicant does not expressly accept or use the credit offered.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{1002-9-a-1-Interp}  \nOfficial Interpretation to 9(a)(1)\n\n\n\n\n\n Paragraph 9(a)(1).\n\n\n\n1. Timing of notice\u2014when an application is complete. Once a creditor has obtained all the information it normally considers in making a credit decision, the application is complete and the creditor has 30 days in which to notify the applicant of the credit decision. (See also comment 2(f)-6.)\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Notification of approval. Notification of approval may be express or by implication. For example, the creditor will satisfy the notification requirement when it gives the applicant the credit card, money, property, or services requested.\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Incomplete application\u2014denial for incompleteness. When an application is incomplete regarding information that the applicant can provide and the creditor lacks sufficient data for a credit decision, the creditor may deny the application giving as the reason for denial that the application is incomplete. The creditor has the option, alternatively, of providing a notice of incompleteness under \u00a7\u00a01002.9(c).\n\n\n\n\n\n4. Incomplete application\u2014denial for reasons other than incompleteness. When an application is missing information but provides sufficient data for a credit decision, the creditor may evaluate the application, make its credit decision, and notify the applicant accordingly. If credit is denied, the applicant must be given the specific reasons for the credit denial (or notice of the right to receive the reasons); in this instance missing information or \u201cincomplete application\u201d cannot be given as the reason for the denial.\n\n\n\n\n\n5. Length of counteroffer. Section 1002.9(a)(1)(iv) does not require a creditor to hold a counteroffer open for 90 days or any other particular length of time.\n\n\n\n\n\n6. Counteroffer combined with adverse action notice. A creditor that gives the applicant a combined counteroffer and adverse action notice that complies with \u00a7\u00a01002.9(a)(2) need not send a second adverse action notice if the applicant does not accept the counteroffer. A sample of a combined notice is contained in form C-4 of Appendix C to the regulation.\n\n\n\n\n\n7. Denial of a telephone application. When an application is made by telephone and adverse action is taken, the creditor must request the applicant's name and address in order to provide written notification under this section. If the applicant declines to provide that information, then the creditor has no further notification responsibility.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee this interpretation in Supplement I\n\n{1002-9-a-1-i}  \n(i) 30 days after receiving a completed application concerning the creditor's approval of, counteroffer to, or adverse action on the application;\n\n{1002-9-a-1-ii}  \n(ii) 30 days after taking adverse action on an incomplete application, unless notice is provided in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section;\n\n{1002-9-a-1-iii}  \n(iii) 30 days after taking adverse action on an existing account; or\n\n{1002-9-a-1-iv}  \n(iv) 90 days after notifying the applicant of a counteroffer if the applicant does not expressly accept or use the credit offered.\n\n{1002-9-a-2}  \n(2) Content of notification when adverse action is taken. A notification given to an applicant when adverse action is taken shall be in writing and shall contain a statement of the action taken; the name and address of the creditor; a statement of the provisions of section 701(a) of the Act; the name and address of the Federal agency that administers compliance with respect to the creditor; and either:\n\n\n\n\n\n(i) A statement of specific reasons for the action taken; or\n\n\n\n\n\n(ii) A disclosure of the applicant's right to a statement of specific reasons within 30 days, if the statement is requested within 60 days of the creditor's notification. The disclosure shall include the name, address, and telephone number of the person or office from which the statement of reasons can be obtained. If the creditor chooses to provide the reasons orally, the creditor shall also disclose the applicant's right to have them confirmed in writing within 30 days of receiving the applicant's written request for confirmation.\n\n{1002-9-a-2-i}  \n(i) A statement of specific reasons for the action taken; or\n\n{1002-9-a-2-ii}  \n(ii) A disclosure of the applicant's right to a statement of specific reasons within 30 days, if the statement is requested within 60 days of the creditor's notification. The disclosure shall include the name, address, and telephone number of the person or office from which the statement of reasons can be obtained. If the creditor chooses to provide the reasons orally, the creditor shall also disclose the applicant's right to have them confirmed in writing within 30 days of receiving the applicant's written request for confirmation.\n\n{1002-9-a-3}  \n(3) Notification to business credit applicants. For business credit, a creditor shall comply with the notification requirements of this section in the following manner:\n\n\n\n\n\n(i) With regard to a business that had gross revenues of $1 million or less in its preceding fiscal year (other than an extension of trade credit, credit incident to a factoring agreement, or other similar types of business credit), a creditor shall comply with paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section, except that:\n\n\n\n\n\n(A) The statement of the action taken may be given orally or in writing, when adverse action is taken;\n\n\n\n\n\n(B) Disclosure of an applicant's right to a statement of reasons may be given at the time of application, instead of when adverse action is taken, provided the disclosure contains the information required by paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section and the ECOA notice specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section;\n\n\n\n\n\n(C) For an application made entirely by telephone, a creditor satisfies the requirements of paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section by an oral statement of the action taken and of the applicant's right to a statement of reasons for adverse action.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(ii) With regard to a business that had gross revenues in excess of $1 million in its preceding fiscal year or an extension of trade credit, credit incident to a factoring agreement, or other similar types of business credit, a creditor shall:\n\n\n\n\n\n(A) Notify the applicant, within a reasonable time, orally or in writing, of the action taken; and\n\n\n\n\n\n(B) Provide a written statement of the reasons for adverse action and the ECOA notice specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section if the applicant makes a written request for the reasons within 60 days of the creditor's notification.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{1002-9-a-3-Interp}  \nOfficial Interpretation to 9(a)(3)\n\n\n\n\n\n Paragraph 9(a)(3).\n\n\n\n1.

A creditor subject to \u00a7\u00a01002.9(a)(3)(ii)(A) is required to notify a business credit applicant, orally or in writing, of action taken on an application within a reasonable time of receiving a completed application. Notice provided in accordance with the timing requirements of \u00a7\u00a01002.9(a)(1) is deemed reasonable in all instances.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee this interpretation in Supplement I\n\n{1002-9-a-3-i}  \n(i) With regard to a business that had gross revenues of $1 million or less in its preceding fiscal year (other than an extension of trade credit, credit incident to a factoring agreement, or other similar types of business credit), a creditor shall comply with paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section, except that:\n\n\n\n\n\n(A) The statement of the action taken may be given orally or in writing, when adverse action is taken;\n\n\n\n\n\n(B) Disclosure of an applicant's right to a statement of reasons may be given at the time of application, instead of when adverse action is taken, provided the disclosure contains the information required by paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section and the ECOA notice specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section;\n\n\n\n\n\n(C) For an application made entirely by telephone, a creditor satisfies the requirements of paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section by an oral statement of the action taken and of the applicant's right to a statement of reasons for adverse action.\n\n{1002-9-a-3-i-A}  \n(A) The statement of the action taken may be given orally or in writing, when adverse action is taken;\n\n{1002-9-a-3-i-B}  \n(B) Disclosure of an applicant's right to a statement of reasons may be given at the time of application, instead of when adverse action is taken, provided the disclosure contains the information required by paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section and the ECOA notice specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section;\n\n{1002-9-a-3-i-C}  \n(C) For an application made entirely by telephone, a creditor satisfies the requirements of paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section by an oral statement of the action taken and of the applicant's right to a statement of reasons for adverse action.\n\n{1002-9-a-3-ii}  \n(ii) With regard to a business that had gross revenues in excess of $1 million in its preceding fiscal year or an extension of trade credit, credit incident to a factoring agreement, or other similar types of business credit, a creditor shall:\n\n\n\n\n\n(A) Notify the applicant, within a reasonable time, orally or in writing, of the action taken; and\n\n\n\n\n\n(B) Provide a written statement of the reasons for adverse action and the ECOA notice specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section if the applicant makes a written request for the reasons within 60 days of the creditor's notification.\n\n{1002-9-a-3-ii-A}  \n(A) Notify the applicant, within a reasonable time, orally or in writing, of the action taken; and\n\n{1002-9-a-3-ii-B}  \n(B) Provide a written statement of the reasons for adverse action and the ECOA notice specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section if the applicant makes a written request for the reasons within 60 days of the creditor's notification.\n\n{1002-9-b}  \n(b) Form of ECOA notice and statement of specific reasons \u2014\n\n\n\n\n\n(1) ECOA notice. To satisfy the disclosure requirements of paragraph (a)(2) of this section regarding section 701(a) of the Act, the creditor shall provide a notice that is substantially similar to the following: The Federal Equal Credit Opportunity Act prohibits creditors from discriminating against credit applicants on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, marital status, age (provided the applicant has the capacity to enter into a binding contract); because all or part of the applicant's income derives from any public assistance program; or because the applicant has in good faith exercised any right under the Consumer Credit Protection Act. The Federal agency that administers compliance with this law concerning this creditor is [name and address as specified by the appropriate agency or agencies listed in Appendix A of this part]. Until January 1, 2013, a creditor may comply with this paragraph (b)(1) and paragraph (a)(2) of this section by including in the notice the name and address as specified by the appropriate agency in Appendix A to 12 CFR part 202, as in effect on October 1, 2011.\n\n\n\n\n{1002-9-b-1-Interp}  \nOfficial Interpretation to 9(b)(1)\n\n\n\n\n\n Paragraph 9(b)(1).\n\n\n\n1. Substantially similar notice. The ECOA notice sent with a notification of a credit denial or other adverse action will comply with the regulation if it is \u201csubstantially similar\u201d to the notice contained in \u00a7\u00a01002.9(b)(1). For example, a creditor may add a reference to the fact that the ECOA permits age to be considered in certain credit scoring systems, or add a reference to a similar state statute or regulation and to a state enforcement agency.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee this interpretation in Supplement I\n\n\n\n(2) Statement of specific reasons. The statement of reasons for adverse action required by paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section must be specific and indicate the principal reason(s) for the adverse action. Statements that the adverse action was based on the creditor's internal standards or policies or that the applicant, joint applicant, or similar party failed to achieve a qualifying score on the creditor's credit scoring system are insufficient.\n\n\n\n\n{1002-9-b-2-Interp}  \nOfficial Interpretation to 9(b)(2)\n\n\n\n\n\n Paragraph 9(b)(2).\n\n\n\n1. Number of specific reasons. A creditor must disclose the principal reasons for denying an application or taking other adverse action. The regulation does not mandate that a specific number of reasons be disclosed, but disclosure of more than four reasons is not likely to be helpful to the applicant.\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Source of specific reasons. The specific reasons disclosed under \u00a7\u00a7\u00a01002.9(a)(2) and (b)(2) must relate to and accurately describe the factors actually considered or scored by a creditor.\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Description of reasons. A creditor need not describe how or why a factor adversely affected an applicant. For example, the notice may say \u201clength of residence\u201d rather than \u201ctoo short a period of residence.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n4. Credit scoring system. If a creditor bases the denial or other adverse action on a credit scoring system, the reasons disclosed must relate only to those factors actually scored in the system. Moreover, no factor that was a principal reason for adverse action may be excluded from disclosure. The creditor must disclose the actual reasons for denial (for example, \u201cage of automobile\u201d) even if the relationship of that factor to predicting creditworthiness may not be clear to the applicant.\n\n\n\n\n\n5. Credit scoring \u2014 method for selecting reasons. The regulation does not require that any one method be used for selecting reasons for a credit denial or other adverse action that is based on a credit scoring system. Various methods will meet the requirements of the regulation. One method is to identify the factors for which the applicant's score fell furthest below the average score for each of those factors achieved by applicants whose total score was at or slightly above the minimum passing score. Another method is to identify the factors for which the applicant's score fell furthest below the average score for each of those factors achieved by all applicants. These average scores could be calculated during the development or use of the system. Any other method that produces results substantially similar to either of these methods is also acceptable under the regulation.\n\n\n\n\n\n6. Judgmental system. If a creditor uses a judgmental system, the reasons for the denial or other adverse action must relate to those factors in the applicant's record actually reviewed by the person making the decision.\n\n\n\n\n\n7. Combined credit scoring and judgmental system. If a creditor denies an application based on a credit evaluation system that employs both credit scoring and judgmental components, the reasons for the denial must come from the component of the system that the applicant failed. For example, if a creditor initially credit scores an application and denies the credit request as a result of that scoring, the reasons disclosed to the applicant must relate to the factors scored in the system. If the application passes the credit scoring stage but the creditor then denies the credit request based on a judgmental assessment of the applicant's record, the reasons disclosed must relate to the factors reviewed judgmentally, even if the factors were also considered in the credit scoring component. If the application is not approved or denied as a result of the credit scoring, but falls into a gray band, and the creditor performs a judgmental assessment and denies the credit after that assessment, the reasons disclosed must come from both components of the system. The same result applies where a judgmental assessment is the first component of the combined system. As provided in comment 9(b)(2)-1, disclosure of more than a combined total of four reasons is not likely to be helpful to the applicant.\n\n\n\n\n\n8. Automatic denial. Some credit decision methods contain features that call for automatic denial because of one or more negative factors in the applicant's record (such as the applicant's previous bad credit history with that creditor, the applicant's declaration of bankruptcy, or the fact that the applicant is a minor). When a creditor denies the credit request because of an automatic-denial factor, the creditor must disclose that specific factor.\n\n\n\n\n\n9. Combined ECOA-FCRA disclosures. The ECOA requires disclosure of the principal reasons for denying or taking other adverse action on an application for an extension of credit. The Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) requires a creditor to disclose when it has based its decision in whole or in part on information from a source other than the applicant or its own files. Disclosing that a credit report was obtained and used in the denial of the application, as the FCRA requires, does not satisfy the ECOA requirement to disclose specific reasons. For example, if the applicant's credit history reveals delinquent credit obligations and the application is denied for that reason, to satisfy \u00a7\u00a01002.9(b)(2) the creditor must disclose that the application was denied because of the applicant's delinquent credit obligations. The FCRA also requires a creditor to disclose, as applicable, a credit score it used in taking adverse action along with related information, including up to four key factors that adversely affected the consumer's credit score (or up to five factors if the number of inquiries made with respect to that consumer report is a key factor). Disclosing the key factors that adversely affected the consumer's credit score does not satisfy the ECOA requirement to disclose specific reasons for denying or taking other adverse action on an application or extension of credit. Sample forms C-1 through C-5 of Appendix C of the regulation provide for both the ECOA and FCRA disclosures. See also comment 9(b)(2)-1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee this interpretation in Supplement I\n\n{1002-9-b-1}  \n(1) ECOA notice. To satisfy the disclosure requirements of paragraph (a)(2) of this section regarding section 701(a) of the Act, the creditor shall provide a notice that is substantially similar to the following: The Federal Equal Credit Opportunity Act prohibits creditors from discriminating against credit applicants on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, marital status, age (provided the applicant has the capacity to enter into a binding contract); because all or part of the applicant's income derives from any public assistance program; or because the applicant has in good faith exercised any right under the Consumer Credit Protection Act.

Within 30 days after receiving an application that is incomplete regarding matters that an applicant can complete, the creditor shall notify the applicant either:\n\n\n\n\n\n(i) Of action taken, in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section; or\n\n\n\n\n\n(ii) Of the incompleteness, in accordance with paragraph (c)(2) of this section.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{1002-9-c-1-Interp}  \nOfficial Interpretation to 9(c)(1)\n\n\n\n\n\n Paragraph 9(c)(1).\n\n\n\n1.

If additional information is needed from an applicant, the creditor shall send a written notice to the applicant specifying the information needed, designating a reasonable period of time for the applicant to provide the information, and informing the applicant that failure to provide the information requested will result in no further consideration being given to the application. The creditor shall have no further obligation under this section if the applicant fails to respond within the designated time period.

If no credit is offered or if the applicant does not expressly accept or use the credit offered, each creditor taking adverse action must comply with this section, directly or through a third party. A notice given by a third party shall disclose the identity of each creditor on whose behalf the notice is given.\n\n\n\n\n{1002-9-g-Interp}  \nOfficial Interpretation to 9(g)\n\n\n\n\n\n 9(g) Applications submitted through a third party.\n\n\n\n1. Third parties. The notification of adverse action may be given by one of the creditors to whom an application was submitted, or by a noncreditor third party. If one notification is provided on behalf of multiple creditors, the notice must contain the name and address of each creditor. The notice must either disclose the applicant's right to a statement of specific reasons within 30 days, or give the primary reasons each creditor relied upon in taking the adverse action\u2014clearly indicating which reasons relate to which creditor.\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Third party notice\u2014enforcement agency. If a single adverse action notice is being provided to an applicant on behalf of several creditors and they are under the jurisdiction of different Federal enforcement agencies, the notice need not name each agency; disclosure of any one of them will suffice.\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Third-party notice\u2014liability. When a notice is to be provided through a third party, a creditor is not liable for an act or omission of the third party that constitutes a violation of the regulation if the creditor accurately and in a timely manner provided the third party with the information necessary for the notification and maintains reasonable procedures adapted to prevent such violations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee this interpretation in Supplement I\n{3382bd13888fa90ba29507aec48d6b2ab59741ae78da70e90618e0d3}  \nPrevious section - \u00a7\u00a01002.8  Special purpose credit programs.\n{e468bfb993da427e0b723041696513098a911a6a7b0ccd9d70870e9d}  \nNext section - \u00a7\u00a01002.10 Furnishing of credit information.",

Except as otherwise provided in this section, this part alters, affects, or preempts only those state laws that are inconsistent with the Act and this part and then only to the extent of the inconsistency. A state law is not inconsistent if it is more protective of an applicant.\r\n\r\n{1002-11-a-Interp}  \r\nOfficial Interpretation to 11(a)\r\n\r\n 11(a) Inconsistent state laws.\r\n\r\n1. Preemption determination\u2014New York. The Bureau recognizes state law preemption determinations made by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System prior to July 21, 2011, until and unless the Bureau makes and publishes any contrary determination. The Board of Governors determined that the following provisions in the state law of New York are preempted by the Federal law, effective November 11, 1988:\r\n\r\ni. Article 15, section 296a(1)(b). Unlawful discriminatory practices in relation to credit on the basis of race, creed, color, national origin, age, sex, marital status, or disability. This provision is preempted to the extent that it bars taking a prohibited basis into account when establishing eligibility for certain special-purpose credit programs.\r\n\r\nii. Article 15, section 296a(1)(c). Unlawful discriminatory practice to make any record or inquiry based on race, creed, color, national origin, age, sex, marital status, or disability. This provision is preempted to the extent that it bars a creditor from requesting and considering information regarding the particular characteristics (for example, race, national origin, or sex) required for eligibility for special-purpose credit programs.\r\n\r\n2. Preemption determination\u2014Ohio. The Bureau recognizes state law preemption determinations made by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System prior to July 21, 2011, until and unless the Bureau makes and publishes any contrary determination. The Board of Governors determined that the following provision in the state law of Ohio is preempted by the Federal law, effective July 23, 1990:\r\n\r\ni. Section 4112.021(B)(1)\u2014Unlawful discriminatory practices in credit transactions. This provision is preempted to the extent that it bars asking or favorably considering the age of an elderly applicant; prohibits the consideration of age in a credit scoring system; permits without limitation the consideration of age in real estate transactions; and limits the consideration of age in special-purpose credit programs to certain government-sponsored programs identified in the state law.\r\n\r\nSee this interpretation in Supplement I\r\n\r\n{1002-11-b}  \r\n(b) Preempted provisions of state law.\r\n\r\n(1) A state law is deemed to be inconsistent with the requirements of the Act and this part and less protective of an applicant within the meaning of section 705(f) of the Act to the extent that the law:\r\n\r\n(i) Requires or permits a practice or act prohibited by the Act or this part;\r\n\r\n(ii) Prohibits the individual extension of consumer credit to both parties to a marriage if each spouse individually and voluntarily applies for such credit;\r\n\r\n(iii) Prohibits inquiries or collection of data required to comply with the Act or this part;\r\n\r\n(iv) Prohibits asking about or considering age in an empirically derived, demonstrably and statistically sound, credit scoring system to determine a pertinent element of creditworthiness, or to favor an elderly applicant; or\r\n\r\n(v) Prohibits inquiries necessary to establish or administer a special purpose credit program as defined by \u00a7\u00a01002.8.\r\n\r\n(2) A creditor, state, or other interested party may request that the Bureau determine whether a state law is inconsistent with the requirements of the Act and this part.\r\n\r\n{1002-11-b-1}  \r\n(1) A state law is deemed to be inconsistent with the requirements of the Act and this part and less protective of an applicant within the meaning of section 705(f) of the Act to the extent that the law:\r\n\r\n(i) Requires or permits a practice or act prohibited by the Act or this part;\r\n\r\n(ii) Prohibits the individual extension of consumer credit to both parties to a marriage if each spouse individually and voluntarily applies for such credit;\r\n\r\n(iii) Prohibits inquiries or collection of data required to comply with the Act or this part;\r\n\r\n(iv) Prohibits asking about or considering age in an empirically derived, demonstrably and statistically sound, credit scoring system to determine a pertinent element of creditworthiness, or to favor an elderly applicant; or\r\n\r\n(v) Prohibits inquiries necessary to establish or administer a special purpose credit program as defined by \u00a7\u00a01002.8.\r\n\r\n{1002-11-b-1-i}  \r\n(i) Requires or permits a practice or act prohibited by the Act or this part;\r\n\r\n{1002-11-b-1-ii}  \r\n(ii) Prohibits the individual extension of consumer credit to both parties to a marriage if each spouse individually and voluntarily applies for such credit;\r\n\r\n{1002-11-b-1-iii}  \r\n(iii) Prohibits inquiries or collection of data required to comply with the Act or this part;\r\n\r\n{1002-11-b-1-iv}  \r\n(iv) Prohibits asking about or considering age in an empirically derived, demonstrably and statistically sound, credit scoring system to determine a pertinent element of creditworthiness, or to favor an elderly applicant; or\r\n\r\n{1002-11-b-1-v}  \r\n(v) Prohibits inquiries necessary to establish or administer a special purpose credit program as defined by \u00a7\u00a01002.8.\r\n\r\n{1002-11-b-2}  \r\n(2) A creditor, state, or other interested party may request that the Bureau determine whether a state law is inconsistent with the requirements of the Act and this part.\r\n\r\n{1002-11-c}  \r\n(c) Laws on finance charges, loan ceilings. If married applicants voluntarily apply for and obtain individual accounts with the same creditor, the accounts shall not be aggregated or otherwise combined for purposes of determining permissible finance charges or loan ceilings under any Federal or state law. Permissible loan ceiling laws shall be construed to permit each spouse to become individually liable up to the amount of the loan ceilings, less the amount for which the applicant is jointly liable.\r\n\r\n{1002-11-d}  \r\n(d) State and Federal laws not affected.

        "contents": "{1002-13-a}   \r\n(a) Information to be requested.\r\n\r\n(1) A creditor that receives an application for credit primarily for the purchase or refinancing of a dwelling occupied or to be occupied by the applicant as a principal residence, where the extension of credit will be secured by the dwelling, shall request as part of the application the following information regarding the applicant(s):\r\n\r\n(i) Ethnicity, using the categories Hispanic or Latino, and not Hispanic or Latino; and race, using the categories American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, Black or African American, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, and White;\r\n\r\n(ii) Sex;\r\n\r\n(iii) Marital status, using the categories married, unmarried, and separated; and\r\n\r\n(iv) Age.\r\n\r\n(2) Dwelling means a residential structure that contains one to four units, whether or not that structure is attached to real property. The term includes, but is not limited to, an individual condominium or cooperative unit and a mobile or other manufactured home.\r\n\r\n{1002-13-a-Interp}  \r\nOfficial Interpretation to 13(a)\r\n\r\n13(a) Information to be requested.\r\n\r\n1. Natural person. Section1002.13 applies only to applications from natural persons.\r\n\r\n2. Principal residence. The requirements of \u00a7\u00a01002.13 apply only if an application relates to a dwelling that is or will be occupied by the applicant as the principal residence. A credit application related to a vacation home or a rental unit is not covered. In the case of a two-to four-unit dwelling, the application is covered if the applicant intends to occupy one of the units as a principal residence.\r\n\r\n3. Temporary financing. An application for temporary financing to construct a dwelling is not subject to \u00a7\u00a01002.13. But an application for both a temporary loan to finance construction of a dwelling and a permanent mortgage loan to take effect upon the completion of construction is subject to \u00a7\u00a01002.13.\r\n\r\n4. New principal residence. A person can have only one principal residence at a time. However, if a person buys or builds a new dwelling that will become that person's principal residence within a year or upon completion of construction, the new dwelling is considered the principal residence for purposes of \u00a7\u00a01002.13.\r\n\r\n5. Transactions not covered. The information-collection requirements of this section apply to applications for credit primarily for the purchase or refinancing of a dwelling that is or will become the applicant's principal residence. Therefore, applications for credit secured by the applicant's principal residence but made primarily for a purpose other than the purchase or refinancing of the principal residence (such as loans for home improvement and debt consolidation) are not subject to the information-collection requirements. An application for an open-end home equity line of credit is not subject to this section unless it is readily apparent to the creditor when the application is taken that the primary purpose of the line is for the purchase or refinancing of a principal dwelling.\r\n\r\n6. Refinancings. A refinancing occurs when an existing obligation is satisfied and replaced by a new obligation undertaken by the same borrower. A creditor that receives an application to refinance an existing extension of credit made by that creditor for the purchase of the applicant's dwelling may request the monitoring information again but is not required to do so if it was obtained in the earlier transaction.\r\n\r\n7. Data collection under Regulation C. See comment 5(a)(2)-2.\r\n\r\nSee this interpretation in Supplement I\r\n\r\n{1002-13-a-1}  \r\n(1) A creditor that receives an application for credit primarily for the purchase or refinancing of a dwelling occupied or to be occupied by the applicant as a principal residence, where the extension of credit will be secured by the dwelling, shall request as part of the application the following information regarding the applicant(s):\r\n\r\n(i) Ethnicity, using the categories Hispanic or Latino, and not Hispanic or Latino; and race, using the categories American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, Black or African American, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, and White;\r\n\r\n(ii) Sex;\r\n\r\n(iii) Marital status, using the categories married, unmarried, and separated; and\r\n\r\n(iv) Age.\r\n\r\n{1002-13-a-1-i}  \r\n(i) Ethnicity, using the categories Hispanic or Latino, and not Hispanic or Latino; and race, using the categories American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, Black or African American, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, and White;\r\n\r\n{1002-13-a-1-ii}  \r\n(ii) Sex;\r\n\r\n{1002-13-a-1-iii}  \r\n(iii) Marital status, using the categories married, unmarried, and separated; and\r\n\r\n{1002-13-a-1-iv}  \r\n(iv) Age.\r\n\r\n{1002-13-a-2}  \r\n(2) Dwelling means a residential structure that contains one to four units, whether or not that structure is attached to real property. The term includes, but is not limited to, an individual condominium or cooperative unit and a mobile or other manufactured home.\r\n\r\n{1002-13-b}  \r\n(b) Obtaining information. Questions regarding ethnicity, race, sex, marital status, and age may be listed, at the creditor's option, on the application form or on a separate form that refers to the application. The applicant(s) shall be asked but not required to supply the requested information. If the applicant(s) chooses not to provide the information or any part of it, that fact shall be noted on the form. The creditor shall then also note on the form, to the extent possible, the ethnicity, race, and sex of the applicant(s) on the basis of visual observation or surname.\r\n\r\n{1002-13-b-Interp}  \r\nOfficial Interpretation to 13(b)\r\n \r\n13(b) Obtaining of information.\r\n\r\n1. Forms for collecting data. A creditor may collect the information specified in \u00a7\u00a01002.13(a) either on an application form or on a separate form referring to the application. The applicant must be offered the option to select more than one racial designation.\r\n\r\n2. Written applications. The regulation requires written applications for the types of credit covered by \u00a7\u00a01002.13. A creditor can satisfy this requirement by recording on paper or by means of computer the information that the applicant provides orally and that the creditor normally considers in a credit decision.\r\n\r\n3. Telephone, mail applications.\r\n\r\ni. A creditor that accepts an application by telephone or mail must request the monitoring information.\r\n\r\nii. A creditor that accepts an application by mail need not make a special request for the monitoring information if the applicant has failed to provide it on the application form returned to the creditor.\r\n\r\niii. If it is not evident on the face of an application that it was received by mail, telephone, or via an electronic medium, the creditor should indicate on the form or other application record how the application was received.\r\n\r\n4. Video and other electronic-application processes.\r\n\r\ni. If a creditor takes an application through an electronic medium that allows the creditor to see the applicant, the creditor must treat the application as taken in person. The creditor must note the monitoring information on the basis of visual observation or surname, if the applicant chooses not to provide the information.\r\n\r\nii. If an applicant applies through an electronic medium without video capability, the creditor treats the application as if it were received by mail.\r\n\r\n5. Applications through loan-shopping services. When a creditor receives an application through an unaffiliated loan-shopping service, it does not have to request the monitoring information for purposes of the ECOA or Regulation B. Creditors subject to the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act should be aware, however, that data collection may be called for under Regulation C (12 CFR part 1003), which generally requires creditors to report, among other things, the sex and race of an applicant on brokered applications or applications received through a correspondent.\r\n\r\n6. Inadvertent notation. If a creditor inadvertently obtains the monitoring information in a dwelling-related transaction not covered by \u00a7\u00a01002.13, the creditor may process and retain the application without violating the regulation.\r\n\r\nSee this interpretation in Supplement I\r\n\r\n{1002-13-c}  \r\n(c) Disclosure to applicant(s). The creditor shall inform the applicant(s) that the information regarding ethnicity, race, sex, marital status, and age is being requested by the Federal Government for the purpose of monitoring compliance with Federal statutes that prohibit creditors from discriminating against applicants on those bases. The creditor shall also inform the applicant(s) that if the applicant(s) chooses not to provide the information, the creditor is required to note the ethnicity, race and sex on the basis of visual observation or surname.\r\n\r\n{1002-13-c-Interp}  \r\nOfficial Interpretation to 13(c)\r\n\r\n13(c) Disclosure to applicants.\r\n\r\n1. Procedures for providing disclosures. The disclosure to an applicant regarding the monitoring information may be provided in writing. Appendix B contains a sample disclosure. A creditor may devise its own disclosure so long as it is substantially similar. The creditor need not orally request the monitoring information if it is requested in writing.\r\n\r\nSee this interpretation in Supplement I\r\n\r\n{1002-13-d}  \r\n(d) Substitute monitoring program. A monitoring program required by an agency charged with administrative enforcement under section 704 of the Act may be substituted for the requirements contained in paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section.\r\n\r\n{1002-13-d-Interp}  \r\nOfficial Interpretation to 13(d)\r\n\r\n 13(d) Substitute monitoring program.\r\n\r\n1. Substitute program. An enforcement agency may adopt, under its established rulemaking or enforcement procedures, a program requiring creditors under its jurisdiction to collect information in addition to information required by this section.\r\n\r\nSee this interpretation in Supplement I\r\n\r\n{dcd406374ab6f421521c8ca7ab136d17a7f144a9858b516347802259}  \r\nPrevious section - \u00a7\u00a01002.12  Record retention.\r\n\r\n{bfb838b20ae3b7c03f6b00eb14118b0846190baf9a1ef8943b01193d}  \r\nNext section - \u00a7\u00a01002.14 Rules on providing appraisals and other valuations.",

Multiple applicants. If there is more than one applicant, the written disclosure about written appraisals, and the copies of appraisals and other written valuations, need only be given to one applicant. However, these materials must be given to the primary applicant where one is readily apparent. Similarly, if there is more than one applicant for credit in the transaction, one applicant may provide a waiver under \u00a7\u00a01002.14(a)(1), but it must be the primary applicant where one is readily apparent.\r\n\r\nSee this interpretation in Supplement I\r\n\r\n{1002-14-a-1}   \r\n(1) In general. A creditor shall provide an applicant a copy of all appraisals and other written valuations developed in connection with an application for credit that is to be secured by a first lien on a dwelling. A creditor shall provide a copy of each such appraisal or other written valuation promptly upon completion, or three business days prior to consummation of the transaction (for closed-end credit) or account opening (for open-end credit), whichever is earlier. An applicant may waive the timing requirement in this paragraph (a)(1) and agree to receive any copy at or before consummation or account opening, except where otherwise prohibited by law. Any such waiver must be obtained at least three business days prior to consummation or account opening, unless the waiver pertains solely to the applicant's receipt of a copy of an appraisal or other written valuation that contains only clerical changes from a previous version of the appraisal or other written valuation provided to the applicant three or more business days prior to consummation or account opening. If the applicant provides a waiver and the transaction is not consummated or the account is not opened, the creditor must provide these copies no later than 30 days after the creditor determines consummation will not occur or the account will not be opened.\r\n\r\n{1002-14-a-1-Interp}  \r\nOfficial Interpretation to 14(a)(1)\r\n\r\n 14(a)(1) In general.\r\n\r\n1. Coverage. Section 1002.14 covers applications for credit to be secured by a first lien on a dwelling, as that term is defined in \u00a7\u00a01002.14(b)(2), whether the credit is for a business purpose (for example, a loan to start a business) or a consumer purpose (for example, a loan to purchase a home).\r\n\r\n2. Renewals. Section 1002.14(a)(1) applies when an applicant requests the renewal of an existing extension of credit and the creditor develops a new appraisal or other written valuation. Section 1002.14(a)(1) does not apply to the extent a creditor uses the appraisals and other written valuations that were previously developed in connection with the prior extension of credit to evaluate the renewal request.\r\n\r\n3. Written. For purposes of \u00a7\u00a01002.14, an \u201cappraisal or other written valuation\u201d includes, without limitation, an appraisal or other valuation received or developed by the creditor in paper form (hard copy); electronically, such as CD or email; or by any other similar media. See \u00a7\u00a01002.14(a)(5) regarding the provision of copies of appraisals and other written valuations to applicants via electronic means.\r\n\r\n4. Timing. Section 1002.14(a)(1) requires that the creditor \u201cprovide\u201d copies of appraisals and other written valuations to the applicant \u201cpromptly upon completion,\u201d or no later than three business days before consummation (for closed-end credit) or account opening (for open-end credit), whichever is earlier.\r\n\r\ni. For purposes of this timing requirement, \u201cprovide\u201d means \u201cdeliver.\u201d Delivery occurs three business days after mailing or delivering the copies to the last-known address of the applicant, or when evidence indicates actual receipt by the applicant, whichever is earlier. Delivery to or actual receipt by the applicant by electronic means must comply with the E-Sign Act, as provided for in \u00a7\u00a01002.14(a)(5).\r\n\r\nii. The application and meaning of the \u201cpromptly upon completion\u201d standard depends upon the facts and circumstances, including but not limited to when the creditor receives the appraisal or other written valuation, and the extent of any review or revision after the creditor receives it.\r\n\r\niii. \u201cCompletion\u201d occurs when the last version is received by the creditor, or when the creditor has reviewed and accepted the appraisal or other written valuation to include any changes or corrections required, whichever is later. See also comment 14(a)(1)-7.\r\n\r\niv. In a transaction that is being consummated (for closed-end credit) or in which the account is being opened (for open-end credit), if an appraisal or other written valuation has been developed but is not yet complete, the deadline for providing a copy of three business days before consummation or account opening still applies, unless the applicant waived that deadline as provided under \u00a7\u00a01002.14(a)(1), in which case the copy must be provided at or before consummation or account opening.\r\n\r\nv. Even if the transaction will not be consummated (for closed-end credit) or the account will not be opened (for open-end credit), the copy must be provided \u201cpromptly upon completion\u201d as provided for in \u00a7\u00a01002.14(a)(1), unless the applicant has waived that deadline as provided under \u00a7\u00a01002.14(a)(1), in which case as provided for in \u00a7\u00a01002.14(a)(1) the copy must be provided to the applicant no later than 30 days after the creditor determines the transaction will not be consummated or the account will not be opened.\r\n\r\n5. Promptly upon completion-examples. Examples in which the \u201cpromptly upon completion\u201d standard would be satisfied include, but are not limited to, those in subparagraphs i, ii, and iii below. Examples in which the \u201cpromptly upon completion\u201d standard would not be satisfied include, but are not limited to, those in subparagraphs iv and v below.\r\n\r\ni. Sending a copy of an appraisal within a week of completion with sufficient time before consummation (or account opening for open-end credit). On day 15 after receipt of the application, the creditor's underwriting department reviews an appraisal and determines it is acceptable. One week later, the creditor sends a copy of the appraisal to the applicant. The applicant actually receives the copy more than three business days before the date of consummation (or account opening). The creditor has provided the copy of the appraisal promptly upon completion.\r\n\r\nii. Sending a copy of a revised appraisal within a week after completion and with sufficient time before consummation (or account opening for open-end credit). An appraisal is being revised, and the creditor does not receive the revised appraisal until day 45 after the application, when the creditor immediately determines the revised appraisal is acceptable. A week later, the creditor sends a copy of the revised appraisal to the applicant, and does not send a copy of the initial appraisal to the applicant. The applicant actually receives the copy of the revised appraisal three business days before the date of consummation (or account opening). The creditor has provided the appraisal copy promptly upon completion.\r\n\r\niii. Sending a copy of an AVM report within a week after its receipt and with sufficient time before consummation (or account opening for open-end credit). The creditor receives an automated valuation model (AVM) report on day 5 after receipt of the application and treats the AVM report as complete when it is received. On day 12 after receipt of the application, the creditor sends the applicant a copy of the valuation. The applicant actually receives the valuation more than three business days before the date of consummation (or account opening). The creditor has provided the copy of the AVM report promptly upon completion.\r\n\r\niv. Delay in sending an appraisal. On day 12 after receipt of the application, the creditor's underwriting department reviews an appraisal and determines it is acceptable. Although the creditor has determined the appraisal is complete, the creditor waits to provide a copy to the applicant until day 42, when the creditor schedules the consummation (or account opening) to occur on day 50. The creditor has not provided the copy of the appraisal promptly upon completion.\r\n\r\nv. Delay in sending an AVM report while waiting for completion of a second valuation. The creditor receives an AVM report on day 5 after application and completes its review of the AVM report the day it is received. The creditor also has ordered an appraisal, but the initial version of the appraisal received by the creditor is found to be deficient and is sent for review. The creditor waits 30 days to provide a copy of the completed AVM report, until the appraisal is completed on day 35. The creditor then provides the applicant with copies of the AVM report and the revised appraisal. While the appraisal report was provided promptly upon completion, the AVM report was not.\r\n\r\n6. Waiver. Section 1002.14(a)(1) permits the applicant to waive the timing requirement if the creditor provides the copies at or before consummation or account opening, except where otherwise prohibited by law. Except where otherwise prohibited by law, an applicant's waiver is effective under \u00a7\u00a01002.14(a)(1) in either of the following two situations:\r\n\r\ni. If, no later than three business days prior to consummation or account opening, the applicant provides the creditor an affirmative oral or written statement waiving the timing requirement under this rule; or\r\n\r\nii. If, within three business days of consummation or account opening, the applicant provides the creditor an affirmative oral or written statement waiving the timing requirement under this rule and the waiver pertains solely to the applicant's receipt of a copy of an appraisal or other written valuation that contains only clerical changes from a previous version of the appraisal or other written valuation provided to the applicant three or more business days prior to consummation or account opening. For purpose of this second type of waiver, revisions will only be considered to be clerical in nature if they have no impact on the estimated value, and have no impact on the calculation or methodology used to derive the estimate. In addition, under \u00a7\u00a01002.14(a)(1) the applicant still must receive the copy of the revision at or prior to consummation or account opening.\r\n\r\n7. Multiple versions of appraisals or valuations. For purposes of \u00a7\u00a01002.14(a)(1), the reference to \u201call\u201d appraisals and other written valuations does not refer to all versions of the same appraisal or other valuation. If a creditor has received multiple versions of an appraisal or other written valuation, the creditor is required to provide only a copy of the latest version received. If, however, a creditor already has provided a copy of one version of an appraisal or other written valuation to an applicant, and the creditor later receives a revision of that appraisal or other written valuation, then the creditor also must provide the applicant with a copy of the revision to comply with \u00a7\u00a01002.14(a)(1). If a creditor receives only one version of an appraisal or other valuation that is developed in connection with the applicant's application, then that version must be provided to the applicant to comply with \u00a7\u00a01002.14(a)(1). See also comment 14(a)(1)-4 above.\r\n\r\nSee this interpretation in Supplement I\r\n\r\n{1002-14-a-2}\r\n(2) Disclosure. For applications subject to paragraph (a)(1) of this section, a creditor shall mail or deliver to an applicant, not later than the third business day after the creditor receives an application for credit that is to be secured by a first lien on a dwelling, a notice in writing of the applicant's right to receive a copy of all written appraisals developed in connection with the application. In the case of an application for credit that is not to be secured by a first lien on a dwelling at the time of application, if the creditor later determines the credit will be secured by a first lien on a dwelling, the creditor shall mail or deliver the same notice in writing not later than the third business day after the creditor determines that the loan is to be secured by a first lien on a dwelling.\r\n\r\n{1002-14-a-2-Interp}  \r\nOfficial Interpretation to 14(a)(2)\r\n\r\n14(a)(2) Disclosure.\r\n\r\n1. Appraisal independence requirements not affected. Nothing in the text of the disclosure required by \u00a7\u00a01002.14(a)(2) should be construed to affect, modify, limit, or supersede the operation of any legal, regulatory, or other requirements or standards relating to independence in the conduct of appraisers or the use of applicant-ordered appraisals by creditors.\r\n\r\nSee this interpretation in Supplement I\r\n\r\n{1002-14-a-3}  \r\n(3) Reimbursement. A creditor shall not charge an applicant for providing a copy of appraisals and other written valuations as required under this section, but may require applicants to pay a reasonable fee to reimburse the creditor for the cost of the appraisal or other written valuation unless otherwise provided by law.\r\n\r\n{1002-14-a-3-Interp}  \r\nOfficial Interpretation to 14(a)(3)\r\n\r\n14(a)(3) Reimbursement.\r\n\r\n1. Photocopy, postage, or other costs. Creditors may not charge for photocopy, postage, or other costs incurred in providing a copy of an appraisal or other written valuation in accordance with section 14(a)(1).\r\n\r\n2. Reasonable fee for reimbursement. Section 1002.14(a)(3) does not prohibit a creditor from imposing a reasonable fee to reimburse the creditor's costs of the appraisal or other written valuation, so long as the fee is not increased to cover the costs of providing copies of such appraisals or other written valuations under \u00a7\u00a01002.14(a)(1). A creditor's cost may include an administration fee charged to the creditor by an appraisal management company as defined in 12 U.S.C. 3350(11). Section 1002.14(a)(3) does not, however, legally obligate the applicant to pay such fees. Further, creditors may not impose fees for reimbursement of the costs of an appraisal or other valuation where otherwise prohibited by law. For instance, a creditor may not charge a consumer a fee for the performance of a second appraisal if the second appraisal is required under 15 U.S.C. 1639h(b)(2) and 12 CFR 1026.35(c).\r\n\r\nSee this interpretation in Supplement I\r\n\r\n{1002-14-a-4}  \r\n(4) Withdrawn, denied, or incomplete applications. The requirements set forth in paragraph (a)(1) of this section apply whether credit is extended or denied or if the application is incomplete or withdrawn.\r\n\r\n{1002-14-a-5}   \r\n(5) Copies in electronic form. The copies required by \u00a7\u00a01002.14(a)(1) may be provided to the applicant in electronic form, subject to compliance with the consumer consent and other applicable provisions of the Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act (E-Sign Act) (15 U.S.C. 7001 et seq.).\r\n\r\n{1002-14-a-1}  \r\n(1) In general. A creditor shall provide an applicant a copy of all appraisals and other written valuations developed in connection with an application for credit that is to be secured by a first lien on a dwelling. A creditor shall provide a copy of each such appraisal or other written valuation promptly upon completion, or three business days prior to consummation of the transaction (for closed-end credit) or account opening (for open-end credit), whichever is earlier. An applicant may waive the timing requirement in this paragraph (a)(1) and agree to receive any copy at or before consummation or account opening, except where otherwise prohibited by law. Any such waiver must be obtained at least three business days prior to consummation or account opening, unless the waiver pertains solely to the applicant's receipt of a copy of an appraisal or other written valuation that contains only clerical changes from a previous version of the appraisal or other written valuation provided to the applicant three or more business days prior to consummation or account opening. If the applicant provides a waiver and the transaction is not consummated or the account is not opened, the creditor must provide these copies no later than 30 days after the creditor determines consummation will not occur or the account will not be opened.\r\n\r\n{1002-14-a-1-Interp}  \r\nOfficial Interpretation to 14(a)(1)\r\n\r\n14(a)(1) In general.\r\n\r\n1. Coverage. Section 1002.14 covers applications for credit to be secured by a first lien on a dwelling, as that term is defined in \u00a7\u00a01002.14(b)(2), whether the credit is for a business purpose (for example, a loan to start a business) or a consumer purpose (for example, a loan to purchase a home).\r\n\r\n2. Renewals. Section 1002.14(a)(1) applies when an applicant requests the renewal of an existing extension of credit and the creditor develops a new appraisal or other written valuation. Section 1002.14(a)(1) does not apply to the extent a creditor uses the appraisals and other written valuations that were previously developed in connection with the prior extension of credit to evaluate the renewal request.\r\n\r\n3. Written. For purposes of \u00a7\u00a01002.14, an \u201cappraisal or other written valuation\u201d includes, without limitation, an appraisal or other valuation received or developed by the creditor in paper form (hard copy); electronically, such as CD or email; or by any other similar media. See \u00a7\u00a01002.14(a)(5) regarding the provision of copies of appraisals and other written valuations to applicants via electronic means.\r\n\r\n4. Timing. Section 1002.14(a)(1) requires that the creditor \u201cprovide\u201d copies of appraisals and other written valuations to the applicant \u201cpromptly upon completion,\u201d or no later than three business days before consummation (for closed-end credit) or account opening (for open-end credit), whichever is earlier.\r\n\r\ni. For purposes of this timing requirement, \u201cprovide\u201d means \u201cdeliver.\u201d Delivery occurs three business days after mailing or delivering the copies to the last-known address of the applicant, or when evidence indicates actual receipt by the applicant, whichever is earlier. Delivery to or actual receipt by the applicant by electronic means must comply with the E-Sign Act, as provided for in \u00a7\u00a01002.14(a)(5).\r\n\r\nii. The application and meaning of the \u201cpromptly upon completion\u201d standard depends upon the facts and circumstances, including but not limited to when the creditor receives the appraisal or other written valuation, and the extent of any review or revision after the creditor receives it.\r\n\r\niii. \u201cCompletion\u201d occurs when the last version is received by the creditor, or when the creditor has reviewed and accepted the appraisal or other written valuation to include any changes or corrections required, whichever is later. See also comment 14(a)(1)-7.\r\n\r\niv. In a transaction that is being consummated (for closed-end credit) or in which the account is being opened (for open-end credit), if an appraisal or other written valuation has been developed but is not yet complete, the deadline for providing a copy of three business days before consummation or account opening still applies, unless the applicant waived that deadline as provided under \u00a7\u00a01002.14(a)(1), in which case the copy must be provided at or before consummation or account opening.\r\n\r\nv. Even if the transaction will not be consummated (for closed-end credit) or the account will not be opened (for open-end credit), the copy must be provided \u201cpromptly upon completion\u201d as provided for in \u00a7\u00a01002.14(a)(1), unless the applicant has waived that deadline as provided under \u00a7\u00a01002.14(a)(1), in which case as provided for in \u00a7\u00a01002.14(a)(1) the copy must be provided to the applicant no later than 30 days after the creditor determines the transaction will not be consummated or the account will not be opened.\r\n\r\n5. Promptly upon completion-examples. Examples in which the \u201cpromptly upon completion\u201d standard would be satisfied include, but are not limited to, those in subparagraphs i, ii, and iii below. Examples in which the \u201cpromptly upon completion\u201d standard would not be satisfied include, but are not limited to, those in subparagraphs iv and v below.\r\n\r\ni. Sending a copy of an appraisal within a week of completion with sufficient time before consummation (or account opening for open-end credit). On day 15 after receipt of the application, the creditor's underwriting department reviews an appraisal and determines it is acceptable. One week later, the creditor sends a copy of the appraisal to the applicant. The applicant actually receives the copy more than three business days before the date of consummation (or account opening). The creditor has provided the copy of the appraisal promptly upon completion.\r\n\r\nii. Sending a copy of a revised appraisal within a week after completion and with sufficient time before consummation (or account opening for open-end credit). An appraisal is being revised, and the creditor does not receive the revised appraisal until day 45 after the application, when the creditor immediately determines the revised appraisal is acceptable. A week later, the creditor sends a copy of the revised appraisal to the applicant, and does not send a copy of the initial appraisal to the applicant. The applicant actually receives the copy of the revised appraisal three business days before the date of consummation (or account opening). The creditor has provided the appraisal copy promptly upon completion.\r\n\r\niii. Sending a copy of an AVM report within a week after its receipt and with sufficient time before consummation (or account opening for open-end credit). The creditor receives an automated valuation model (AVM) report on day 5 after receipt of the application and treats the AVM report as complete when it is received. On day 12 after receipt of the application, the creditor sends the applicant a copy of the valuation. The applicant actually receives the valuation more than three business days before the date of consummation (or account opening). The creditor has provided the copy of the AVM report promptly upon completion.\r\n\r\niv. Delay in sending an appraisal. On day 12 after receipt of the application, the creditor's underwriting department reviews an appraisal and determines it is acceptable. Although the creditor has determined the appraisal is complete, the creditor waits to provide a copy to the applicant until day 42, when the creditor schedules the consummation (or account opening) to occur on day 50. The creditor has not provided the copy of the appraisal promptly upon completion.\r\n\r\nv. Delay in sending an AVM report while waiting for completion of a second valuation. The creditor receives an AVM report on day 5 after application and completes its review of the AVM report the day it is received. The creditor also has ordered an appraisal, but the initial version of the appraisal received by the creditor is found to be deficient and is sent for review. The creditor waits 30 days to provide a copy of the completed AVM report, until the appraisal is completed on day 35. The creditor then provides the applicant with copies of the AVM report and the revised appraisal. While the appraisal report was provided promptly upon completion, the AVM report was not.\r\n\r\n6. Waiver. Section 1002.14(a)(1) permits the applicant to waive the timing requirement if the creditor provides the copies at or before consummation or account opening, except where otherwise prohibited by law. Except where otherwise prohibited by law, an applicant's waiver is effective under \u00a7\u00a01002.14(a)(1) in either of the following two situations:\r\n\r\ni. If, no later than three business days prior to consummation or account opening, the applicant provides the creditor an affirmative oral or written statement waiving the timing requirement under this rule; or\r\n\r\nii. If, within three business days of consummation or account opening, the applicant provides the creditor an affirmative oral or written statement waiving the timing requirement under this rule and the waiver pertains solely to the applicant's receipt of a copy of an appraisal or other written valuation that contains only clerical changes from a previous version of the appraisal or other written valuation provided to the applicant three or more business days prior to consummation or account opening. For purpose of this second type of waiver, revisions will only be considered to be clerical in nature if they have no impact on the estimated value, and have no impact on the calculation or methodology used to derive the estimate. In addition, under \u00a7\u00a01002.14(a)(1) the applicant still must receive the copy of the revision at or prior to consummation or account opening.\r\n\r\n7. Multiple versions of appraisals or valuations. For purposes of \u00a7\u00a01002.14(a)(1), the reference to \u201call\u201d appraisals and other written valuations does not refer to all versions of the same appraisal or other valuation. If a creditor has received multiple versions of an appraisal or other written valuation, the creditor is required to provide only a copy of the latest version received. If, however, a creditor already has provided a copy of one version of an appraisal or other written valuation to an applicant, and the creditor later receives a revision of that appraisal or other written valuation, then the creditor also must provide the applicant with a copy of the revision to comply with \u00a7\u00a01002.14(a)(1). If a creditor receives only one version of an appraisal or other valuation that is developed in connection with the applicant's application, then that version must be provided to the applicant to comply with \u00a7\u00a01002.14(a)(1). See also comment 14(a)(1)-4 above.\r\n\r\nSee this interpretation in Supplement I\r\n\r\n{1002-14-a-2}  \r\n(2) Disclosure. For applications subject to paragraph (a)(1) of this section, a creditor shall mail or deliver to an applicant, not later than the third business day after the creditor receives an application for credit that is to be secured by a first lien on a dwelling, a notice in writing of the applicant's right to receive a copy of all written appraisals developed in connection with the application. In the case of an application for credit that is not to be secured by a first lien on a dwelling at the time of application, if the creditor later determines the credit will be secured by a first lien on a dwelling, the creditor shall mail or deliver the same notice in writing not later than the third business day after the creditor determines that the loan is to be secured by a first lien on a dwelling.\r\n\r\n{1002-14-a-2-Interp}  \r\nOfficial Interpretation to 14(a)(2)\r\n\r\n14(a)(2) Disclosure.\r\n\r\n1. Appraisal independence requirements not affected. Nothing in the text of the disclosure required by \u00a7\u00a01002.14(a)(2) should be construed to affect, modify, limit, or supersede the operation of any legal, regulatory, or other requirements or standards relating to independence in the conduct of appraisers or the use of applicant-ordered appraisals by creditors.\r\n\r\nSee this interpretation in Supplement I\r\n\r\n{1002-14-a-3}  \r\n(3) Reimbursement. A creditor shall not charge an applicant for providing a copy of appraisals and other written valuations as required under this section, but may require applicants to pay a reasonable fee to reimburse the creditor for the cost of the appraisal or other written valuation unless otherwise provided by law.\r\n\r\n{1002-14-a-3-Interp}  \r\nOfficial Interpretation to 14(a)(3)\r\n\r\n14(a)(3) Reimbursement.\r\n\r\n1. Photocopy, postage, or other costs. Creditors may not charge for photocopy, postage, or other costs incurred in providing a copy of an appraisal or other written valuation in accordance with section 14(a)(1).\r\n\r\n2. Reasonable fee for reimbursement. Section 1002.14(a)(3) does not prohibit a creditor from imposing a reasonable fee to reimburse the creditor's costs of the appraisal or other written valuation, so long as the fee is not increased to cover the costs of providing copies of such appraisals or other written valuations under \u00a7\u00a01002.14(a)(1). A creditor's cost may include an administration fee charged to the creditor by an appraisal management company as defined in 12 U.S.C. 3350(11). Section 1002.14(a)(3) does not, however, legally obligate the applicant to pay such fees. Further, creditors may not impose fees for reimbursement of the costs of an appraisal or other valuation where otherwise prohibited by law. For instance, a creditor may not charge a consumer a fee for the performance of a second appraisal if the second appraisal is required under 15 U.S.C. 1639h(b)(2) and 12 CFR 1026.35(c).\r\n\r\nSee this interpretation in Supplement I\r\n\r\n{1002-14-a-4}  \r\n(4) Withdrawn, denied, or incomplete applications. The requirements set forth in paragraph (a)(1) of this section apply whether credit is extended or denied or if the application is incomplete or withdrawn.\r\n\r\n{1002-14-a-5}  \r\n(5) Copies in electronic form. The copies required by \u00a7\u00a01002.14(a)(1) may be provided to the applicant in electronic form, subject to compliance with the consumer consent and other applicable provisions of the Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act (E-Sign Act) (15 U.S.C. 7001 et seq.).\r\n\r\n{1002-14-b}  \r\n(b) Definitions. For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section:\r\n\r\n{1002-14-b-1}   \r\n(1) Consummation. The term \u201cconsummation\u201d means the time that a consumer becomes contractually obligated on a closed-end credit transaction.\r\n\r\n{1002-14-b-1-Interp}  \r\nOfficial Interpretation to 14(b)(1)\r\n\r\n14(b)(1) Consummation.\r\n\r\n1. State law governs. When a contractual obligation on the consumer's part is created is a matter to be determined under applicable law; \u00a7\u00a01002.14 does not make this determination. A contractual commitment agreement, for example, that under applicable law binds the consumer to the credit terms would be consummation. Consummation, however, does not occur merely because the consumer has made some financial investment in the transaction (for example, by paying a nonrefundable fee) unless, of course, applicable law holds otherwise.\r\n\r\n2.

The report or results of a self-test that a creditor voluntarily conducts (or authorizes) are privileged as provided in this section. Data collection required by law or by any governmental authority is not a voluntary self-test.\r\n\r\n{1002-15-a-1-Interp}  \r\nOfficial Interpretation to 15(a)(1)\r\n\r\n15(a)(1) Voluntary self-testing and correction.\r\n\r\n1. Activities required by any governmental authority are not voluntary self-tests. A governmental authority includes both administrative and judicial authorities for Federal, State, and local governments.\r\n\r\nSee this interpretation in Supplement I\r\n\r\n\r\n{1002-15-a-2}   \r\n(2) Corrective action required. The privilege in this section applies only if the creditor has taken or is taking appropriate corrective action.\r\n\r\n{1002-15-a-2-Interp}  \r\nOfficial Interpretation to 15(a)(2)\r\n\r\n15(a)(2) Corrective action required.\r\n\r\n1. To qualify for the privilege, appropriate corrective action is required when the results of a self-test show that it is more likely than not that there has been a violation of the ECOA or this part. A self-test is also privileged when it identifies no violations.\r\n\r\n2. In some cases, the issue of whether certain information is privileged may arise before the self-test is complete or corrective actions are fully under way. This would not necessarily prevent a creditor from asserting the privilege. In situations where the self-test is not complete, for the privilege to apply the lender must satisfy the regulation's requirements within a reasonable period of time. To assert the privilege where the self-test shows a likely violation, the rule requires, at a minimum, that the creditor establish a plan for corrective action and a method to demonstrate progress in implementing the plan. Creditors must take appropriate corrective action on a timely basis after the results of the self-test are known.\r\n\r\n3. A creditor's determination about the type of corrective action needed, or a finding that no corrective action is required, is not conclusive in determining whether the requirements of this paragraph have been satisfied. If a creditor's claim of privilege is challenged, an assessment of the need for corrective action or the type of corrective action that is appropriate must be based on a review of the self-testing results, which may require an in camera inspection of the privileged documents.\r\n\r\nSee this interpretation in Supplement I\r\n\r\n\r\n{1002-15-a-3}     \r\n(3) Other privileges. The privilege created by this section does not preclude the assertion of any other privilege that may also apply.\r\n\r\n{1002-15-a-3-Interp}  \r\nOfficial Interpretation to 15(a)(3)\r\n\r\n15(a)(3) Other privileges.\r\n\r\n1. A creditor may assert the privilege established under this section in addition to asserting any other privilege that may apply, such as the attorney-client privilege or the work-product privilege. Self-testing data may be privileged under this section whether or not the creditor's assertion of another privilege is upheld.\r\n\r\nSee this interpretation in Supplement I\r\n\r\n{1002-15-b}   \r\n(b) Self-test defined \u2014\r\n\r\n{1002-15-b-1}   \r\n(1) Definition. A self-test is any program, practice, or study that:\r\n\r\n{1002-15-b-1-i}   \r\n(i) Is designed and used specifically to determine the extent or effectiveness of a creditor's compliance with the Act or this part; and\r\n\r\n{1002-15-b-1-i-Interp}  \r\nOfficial Interpretation to 15(b)(1)(i)\r\n\r\n Paragraph 15(b)(1)(i).\r\n\r\n1. To qualify for the privilege, a self-test must be sufficient to constitute a determination of the extent or effectiveness of the creditor's compliance with the Act and Regulation B. Accordingly, a self-test is only privileged if it was designed and used for that purpose. A self-test that is designed or used to determine compliance with other laws or regulations or for other purposes is not privileged under this rule. For example, a self-test designed to evaluate employee efficiency or customers' satisfaction with the level of service provided by the creditor is not privileged even if evidence of discrimination is uncovered incidentally. If a self-test is designed for multiple purposes, only the portion designed to determine compliance with the ECOA is eligible for the privilege.\r\n\r\nSee this interpretation in Supplement I\r\n\r\n\r\n{1002-15-b-1-ii}   \r\n(ii) Creates data or factual information that is not available and cannot be derived from loan or application files or other records related to credit transactions.\r\n\r\n{1002-15-b-1-ii-Interp}  \r\nOfficial Interpretation to 15(b)(1)(ii)\r\n\r\n Paragraph 15(b)(1)(ii).\r\n\r\n1. The principal attribute of self-testing is that it constitutes a voluntary undertaking by the creditor to produce new data or factual information that otherwise would not be available and could not be derived from loan or application files or other records related to credit transactions. Self-testing includes, but is not limited to, the practice of using fictitious applicants for credit (testers), either with or without the use of matched pairs. A creditor may elect to test a defined segment of its business, for example, loan applications processed by a specific branch or loan officer, or applications made for a particular type of credit or loan program. A creditor also may use other methods of generating information that is not available in loan and application files, such as surveying mortgage loan applicants. To the extent permitted by law, creditors might also develop new methods that go beyond traditional pre-application testing, such as hiring testers to submit fictitious loan applications for processing.\r\n\r\n2. The privilege does not protect a creditor's analysis performed as part of processing or underwriting a credit application. A creditor's evaluation or analysis of its loan files, Home Mortgage Disclosure Act data, or similar types of records (such as broker or loan officer compensation records) does not produce new information about a creditor's compliance and is not a self-test for purposes of this section. Similarly, a statistical analysis of data derived from existing loan files is not privileged.\r\n\r\nSee this interpretation in Supplement I\r\n\r\n{1002-15-b-2}   \r\n(2) Types of information privileged. The privilege under this section applies to the report or results of the self-test, data or factual information created by the self-test, and any analysis, opinions, and conclusions pertaining to the self-test report or results. The privilege covers workpapers or draft documents as well as final documents.\r\n\r\n{1002-15-b-3}   \r\n(3) Types of information not privileged. The privilege under this section does not apply to:\r\n\r\n{1002-15-b-3-i}  \r\n(i) Information about whether a creditor conducted a self-test, the methodology used or the scope of the self-test, the time period covered by the self-test, or the dates it was conducted; or\r\n\r\n{1002-15-b-3-i-Interp}  \r\nOfficial Interpretation to 15(b)(3)(i)\r\n\r\nParagraph 15(b)(3)(i).\r\n\r\n1. The information listed in this paragraph is not privileged and may be used to determine whether the prerequisites for the privilege have been satisfied. Accordingly, a creditor might be asked to identify the self-testing method, for example, whether preapplication testers were used or data were compiled by surveying loan applicants. Information about the scope of the self-test (such as the types of credit transactions examined, or the geographic area covered by the test) also is not privileged.\r\n\r\nSee this interpretation in Supplement I\r\n\r\n{1002-15-b-3-ii}  \r\n(ii) Loan and application files or other business records related to credit transactions, and information derived from such files and records, even if the information has been aggregated, summarized, or reorganized to facilitate analysis.\r\n\r\n{1002-15-b-3-ii-Interp}  \r\nOfficial Interpretation to 15(b)(3)(ii)\r\n\r\nParagraph 15(b)(3)(ii).\r\n\r\n1. Property appraisal reports, minutes of loan committee meetings or other documents reflecting the basis for a decision to approve or deny an application, loan policies or procedures, underwriting standards, and broker compensation records are examples of the types of records that are not privileged. If a creditor arranges for testers to submit loan applications for processing, the records are not related to actual credit transactions for purposes of this paragraph and may be privileged self-testing records.\r\n\r\nSee this interpretation in Supplement I\r\n\r\n{1002-15-c}  \r\n(c) Appropriate corrective action \u2014\r\n\r\n{1002-15-c-Interp}  \r\nOfficial Interpretation to 15(c)\r\n\r\n15(c) Appropriate corrective action.\r\n\r\n1. The rule only addresses the corrective actions required for a creditor to take advantage of the privilege in this section. A creditor may be required to take other actions or provide additional relief if a formal finding of discrimination is made.\r\n\r\nSee this interpretation in Supplement I\r\n\r\n{1002-15-c-1}  \r\n(1) General requirement. For the privilege in this section to apply, appropriate corrective action is required when the self-test shows that it is more likely than not that a violation occurred, even though no violation has been formally adjudicated.\r\n\r\n{1002-15-c-1-Interp}  \r\nOfficial Interpretation to 15(c)(1)\r\n\r\n15(c)(1) General requirement.\r\n\r\n1. Appropriate corrective action is required even though no violation has been formally adjudicated or admitted by the creditor. In determining whether it is more likely than not that a violation occurred, a creditor must treat testers as if they are actual applicants for credit. A creditor may not refuse to take appropriate corrective action under this section because the self-test used fictitious loan applicants. The fact that a tester's agreement with the creditor waives the tester's legal right to assert a violation does not eliminate the requirement for the creditor to take corrective action, although no remedial relief for the tester is required under paragraph 15(c)(3).\r\n\r\nSee this interpretation in Supplement I\r\n\r\n{1002-15-c-2}  \r\n(2) Determining the scope of appropriate corrective action. A creditor must take corrective action that is reasonably likely to remedy the cause and effect of a likely violation by:\r\n\r\n(i) Identifying the policies or practices that are the likely cause of the violation; and\r\n\r\n(ii) Assessing the extent and scope of any violation.\r\n\r\n{1002-15-c-2-Interp}  \r\nOfficial Interpretation to 15(c)(2)\r\n\r\n 15(c)(2) Determining the scope of appropriate corrective action.\r\n\r\n1. Whether a creditor has taken or is taking corrective action that is appropriate will be determined on a case-by-case basis. Generally, the scope of the corrective action that is needed to preserve the privilege is governed by the scope of the self-test. For example, a creditor that self-tests mortgage loans and discovers evidence of discrimination may focus its corrective actions on mortgage loans, and is not required to expand its testing to other types of loans.\r\n\r\n2. In identifying the policies or practices that are a likely cause of the violation, a creditor might identify inadequate or improper lending policies, failure to implement established policies, employee conduct, or other causes. The extent and scope of a likely violation may be assessed by determining which areas of operations are likely to be affected by those policies and practices, for example, by determining the types of loans and stages of the application process involved and the branches or offices where the violations may have occurred.\r\n\r\n3. Depending on the method and scope of the self-test and the results of the test, appropriate corrective action may include one or more of the following:\r\n\r\ni. If the self-test identifies individuals whose applications were inappropriately processed, offering to extend credit if the application was improperly denied and compensating such persons for out-of-pocket costs and other compensatory damages;\r\n\r\nii. Correcting institutional policies or procedures that may have contributed to the likely violation, and adopting new policies as appropriate;\r\n\r\niii. Identifying and then training and/or disciplining the employees involved;\r\n\r\niv. Developing outreach programs, marketing strategies, or loan products to serve more effectively segments of the lender's markets that may have been affected by the likely discrimination; and\r\n\r\nv. Improving audit and oversight systems to avoid a recurrence of the likely violations.\r\n\r\nSee this interpretation in Supplement I\r\n\r\n{1002-15-c-3}  \r\n(3) Types of relief. Appropriate corrective action may include both prospective and remedial relief, except that to establish a privilege under this section:\r\n\r\n(i) A creditor is not required to provide remedial relief to a tester used in a self-test;\r\n\r\n(ii) A creditor is only required to provide remedial relief to an applicant identified by the self-test as one whose rights were more likely than not violated; and\r\n\r\n{1002-15-c-3-ii-Interp}  \r\nOfficial Interpretation to 15(c)(3)(ii)\r\n\r\nParagraph 15(c)(3)(ii).\r\n\r\n1. The use of pre-application testers to identify policies and practices that illegally discriminate does not require creditors to review existing loan files for the purpose of identifying and compensating applicants who might have been adversely affected.\r\n\r\n2. If a self-test identifies a specific applicant who was discriminated against on a prohibited basis, to qualify for the privilege in this section the creditor must provide appropriate remedial relief to that applicant; the creditor is not required to identify other applicants who might also have been adversely affected.\r\n\r\nSee this interpretation in Supplement I\r\n\r\n{1002-15-c-3-iii}  \r\n(iii) A creditor is not required to provide remedial relief to a particular applicant if the statute of limitations applicable to the violation expired before the creditor obtained the results of the self-test or the applicant is otherwise ineligible for such relief.\r\n\r\n{1002-15-c-3-iii-Interp}  \r\nOfficial Interpretation to 15(c)(3)(iii)\r\n\r\nParagraph 15(c)(3)(iii).\r\n\r\n1. A creditor is not required to provide remedial relief to an applicant that would not be available by law. An applicant might also be ineligible for certain types of relief due to changed circumstances. For example, a creditor is not required to offer credit to a denied applicant if the applicant no longer qualifies for the credit due to a change in financial circumstances, although some other type of relief might be appropriate.\r\n\r\nSee this interpretation in Supplement I\r\n\r\n{1002-15-c-4}  \r\n(4) No admission of violation. Taking corrective action is not an admission that a violation occurred.\r\n\r\n{1002-15-d}  \r\n(d) Scope of privilege \u2014\r\n\r\n{1002-15-d-1}  \r\n(1) General rule. The report or results of a privileged self-test may not be obtained or used:\r\n\r\n(i) By a government agency in any examination or investigation relating to compliance with the Act or this part; or\r\n\r\n(ii) By a government agency or an applicant (including a prospective applicant who alleges a violation of \u00a7\u00a01002.4(b)) in any proceeding or civil action in which a violation of the Act or this part is alleged.\r\n\r\n{1002-15-d-1-Interp}  \r\nOfficial Interpretation to 15(d)(1)\r\n\r\n15(d)(1) Scope of privilege.\r\n\r\n1. The privilege applies with respect to any examination, investigation or proceeding by Federal, State, or local government agencies relating to compliance with the Act or this part. Accordingly, in a case brought under the ECOA, the privilege established under this section preempts any inconsistent laws or court rules to the extent they might require disclosure of privileged self-testing data. The privilege does not apply in other cases (such as in litigation filed solely under a State's fair lending statute). In such cases, if a court orders a creditor to disclose self-test results, the disclosure is not a voluntary disclosure or waiver of the privilege for purposes of paragraph 15(d)(2); a creditor may protect the information by seeking a protective order to limit availability and use of the self-testing data and prevent dissemination beyond what is necessary in that case. Paragraph 15(d)(1) precludes a party who has obtained privileged information from using it in a case brought under the ECOA, provided the creditor has not lost the privilege through voluntary disclosure under paragraph 15(d)(2).\r\n\r\nSee this interpretation in Supplement I\r\n\r\n{1002-15-d-2}  \r\n(2) Loss of privilege. The report or results of a self-test are not privileged under paragraph (d)(1) of this section if the creditor or a person with lawful access to the report or results:\r\n\r\n(i) Voluntarily discloses any part of the report or results, or any other information privileged under this section, to an applicant or government agency or to the public;\r\n\r\n{1002-15-d-2-i-Interp}  \r\nOfficial Interpretation to 15(d)(2)(i)\r\n\r\nParagraph 15(d)(2)(i).\r\n\r\n1. A creditor's corrective action, by itself, is not considered a voluntary disclosure of the self-test report or results. For example, a creditor does not disclose the results of a self-test merely by offering to extend credit to a denied applicant or by inviting the applicant to reapply for credit. Voluntary disclosure could occur under this paragraph, however, if the creditor disclosed the self-test results in connection with a new offer of credit.\r\n\r\n2. The disclosure of self-testing results to an independent contractor acting as an auditor or consultant for the creditor on compliance matters does not result in loss of the privilege.\r\n\r\nSee this interpretation in Supplement I\r\n\r\n(ii) Discloses any part of the report or results, or any other information privileged under this section, as a defense to charges that the creditor has violated the Act or regulation; or\r\n\r\n{1002-15-d-2-ii-Interp}  \r\nOfficial Interpretation to 15(d)(2)(ii)\r\n\r\nParagraph 15(d)(2)(ii).\r\n\r\n1. The privilege is lost if the creditor discloses privileged information, such as the results of the self-test. The privilege is not lost if the creditor merely reveals or refers to the existence of the self-test.\r\n\r\nSee this interpretation in Supplement I\r\n\r\n(iii) Fails or is unable to produce written or recorded information about the self-test that is required to be retained under \u00a7\u00a01002.12(b)(6) when the information is needed to determine whether the privilege applies. This paragraph does not limit any other penalty or remedy that may be available for a violation of \u00a7\u00a01002.12.\r\n\r\n{1002-15-d-2-iii-Interp}  \r\nOfficial Interpretation to 15(d)(2)(iii)\r\n\r\nParagraph 15(d)(2)(iii).\r\n\r\n1. A creditor's claim of privilege may be challenged in a court or administrative law proceeding with appropriate jurisdiction. In resolving the issue, the presiding officer may require the creditor to produce privileged information about the self-test.\r\n\r\nSee this interpretation in Supplement I\r\n\r\n{1002-15-d-3}  \r\n(3) Limited use of privileged information.

On discovering an error under \u00a7\u00a7\u00a01002.9 and 1002.10, the creditor shall correct it as soon as possible. If a creditor inadvertently obtains the monitoring information regarding the ethnicity, race, and sex of the applicant in a dwelling-related transaction not covered by \u00a7\u00a01002.13, the creditor may retain information and act on the application without violating the regulation.\n\n\n\n\n{1002-16-c-Interp}  \nOfficial Interpretation to 16(c)\n\n\n\n\n\n 16(c) Failure of compliance.\n\n\n\n1.

A consumer authorizes a one-time electronic fund transfer from his or her account to pay the fee for the returned item or transfer if the person collecting the fee provides notice to the consumer stating that the person may electronically collect the fee, and the consumer goes forward with the underlying transaction. The notice must state that the fee will be collected by means of an electronic fund transfer from the consumer's account if the payment is returned unpaid and must disclose the dollar amount of the fee. If the fee may vary due to the amount of the transaction or due to other factors, then, except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section, the person collecting the fee may disclose, in place of the dollar amount of the fee, an explanation of how the fee will be determined.\r\n\r\n{b-3-ii}\r\n(ii) *Point-of-sale transactions.* If a fee for an electronic fund transfer or check returned unpaid may be collected electronically in connection with a point-of-sale transaction, the person initiating an electronic fund transfer to collect the fee must post the notice described in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section in a prominent and conspicuous location. The person also must either provide the consumer with a copy of the posted notice (or a substantially similar notice) at the time of the transaction, or mail the copy (or a substantially similar notice) to the consumer's address as soon as reasonably practicable after the person initiates the electronic fund transfer to collect the fee. If the amount of the fee may vary due to the amount of the transaction or due to other factors, the posted notice may explain how the fee will be determined, but the notice provided to the consumer must state the dollar amount of the fee if the amount can be calculated at the time the notice is provided or mailed to the consumer.\r\n\r\n{c}\r\n(c) *Exclusions from coverage.* The term \u201celectronic fund transfer\u201d does not include:\r\n\r\n{c-1}\r\n(1) *Checks.* Any transfer of funds originated by check, draft, or similar paper instrument; or any payment made by check, draft, or similar paper instrument at an electronic terminal.\r\n\r\nsee(3-c-1-Interp)\r\n\r\n{c-2}\r\n(2) *Check guarantee or authorization.* Any transfer of funds that guarantees payment or authorizes acceptance of a check, draft, or similar paper instrument but that does not directly result in a debit or credit to a consumer's account.\r\n\r\nsee(3-c-2-Interp)\r\n\r\n{c-3}\r\n(3) *Wire or other similar transfers.* Any transfer of funds through Fedwire or through a similar wire transfer system that is used primarily for transfers between financial institutions or between businesses.\r\n\r\nsee(3-c-3-Interp)\r\n\r\n{c-4}\r\n(4) *Securities and commodities transfers.* Any transfer of funds the primary purpose of which is the purchase or sale of a security or commodity, if the security or commodity is:\r\n\r\nsee(3-c-4-Interp)\r\n\r\n{c-4-i}\r\n(i) Regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission or the Commodity Futures Trading Commission;\r\n\r\n{c-4-ii}\r\n(ii) Purchased or sold through a broker-dealer regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission or through a futures commission merchant regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission; or\r\n\r\n{c-4-iii}\r\n(iii) Held in book-entry form by a Federal Reserve Bank or Federal agency.\r\n\r\n{c-5}\r\n(5) *Automatic transfers by account-holding institution.* Any transfer of funds under an agreement between a consumer and a financial institution which provides that the institution will initiate individual transfers without a specific request from the consumer:\r\n\r\nsee(3-c-5-Interp)\r\n\r\n{c-5-i}\r\n(i) Between a consumer's accounts within the financial institution;\r\n\r\n{c-5-ii}\r\n(ii) From a consumer's account to an account of a member of the consumer's family held in the same financial institution; or\r\n\r\n{c-5-iii}\r\n(iii) Between a consumer's account and an account of the financial institution, except that these transfers remain subject to \u00a7 1005.10(e) regarding compulsory use and sections 916 and 917 of the Act regarding civil and criminal liability.\r\n\r\n{c-6}\r\n(6) *Telephone-initiated transfers.* Any transfer of funds that:\r\n\r\nsee(3-c-6-Interp)\r\n\r\n{c-6-i}\r\n(i) Is initiated by a telephone communication between a consumer and a financial institution making the transfer; and\r\n\r\n{c-6-ii}\r\n(ii) Does not take place under a telephone bill-payment or other written plan in which periodic or recurring transfers are contemplated.\r\n\r\n{c-7}\r\n(7) *Small institutions.* Any preauthorized transfer to or from an account if the assets of the account-holding financial institution were $100 million or less on the preceding December 31. If assets of the account-holding institution subsequently exceed $100 million, the institution's exemption for preauthorized transfers terminates one year from the end of the calendar year in which the assets exceed $100 million. Preauthorized transfers exempt under this paragraph (c)(7) remain subject to \u00a7 1005.10(e) regarding compulsory use and sections 916 and 917 of the Act regarding civil and criminal liability.\r\n\r\nsee(3-c-7-Interp)\r\n",

However, if the creditor is the remittance transfer provider, paragraph (b) of this section will apply instead of 12 CFR 1026.13(b). If the sender instead provides a notice of error to the remittance transfer provider that is not also the creditor, then the error-resolution provisions of this section apply to the remittance transfer provider.\r\n\r\n{f-3}\r\n(3) *Unauthorized remittance transfers.* If an alleged error involves an unauthorized electronic fund transfer for payment in connection with a remittance transfer, \u00a7\u00a7 1005.6 and 1005.11 apply with respect to the account-holding institution.

Such policies and procedures must ensure, at a minimum, the retention of any notices of error submitted by a sender, documentation provided by the sender to the provider with respect to the alleged error, and the findings of the remittance transfer provider regarding the investigation of the alleged error.

        "contents": "{30-Interp}\r\n### Section 1005.30 - Remittance Transfer Definitions\r\n\r\n{30-Interp-1}\r\n1. *Applicability of definitions in subpart A.* Except as modified or limited by subpart B (which modifications or limitations apply only to subpart B), the definitions in \u00a7 1005.2 apply to all of Regulation E, including subpart B.\r\n\r\n{30-b-Interp}\r\n#### 30(b) Business Day\r\n\r\n{30-b-Interp-1}\r\n1. *General.* A business day, as defined in \u00a7 1005.30(b), includes the entire 24-hour period ending at midnight, and a notice given pursuant to any section of subpart B is effective even if given outside of normal business hours. A remittance transfer provider is not required under subpart B to make telephone lines available on a 24-hour basis.\r\n\r\n{30-b-Interp-2}\r\n2. *Substantially all business functions.* \u201cSubstantially all business functions\u201d include both the public and the back-office operations of the provider. For example, if the offices of a provider are open on Saturdays for customers to request remittance transfers, but not for performing internal functions (such as investigating errors), then Saturday is not a business day for that provider. In this case, Saturday does not count toward the business-day standard set by subpart B for resolving errors, processing refunds, etc.\r\n\r\n{30-b-Interp-3}\r\n3. *Short hours.* A provider may determine, at its election, whether an abbreviated day is a business day. For example, if a provider engages in substantially all business functions until noon on Saturdays instead of its usual 3 p.m. closing, it may consider Saturday a business day.\r\n\r\n{30-b-Interp-4}\r\n4. *Telephone line.* If a provider makes a telephone line available on Sundays for cancelling the transfer, but performs no other business functions, Sunday is not a business day under the \u201csubstantially all business functions\u201d standard.\r\n\r\n{30-c-Interp}\r\n#### 30(c) Designated Recipient\r\n\r\n{30-c-Interp-1}\r\n1. *Person.* A designated recipient can be either a natural person or an organization, such as a corporation. *See* \u00a7 1005.2(j) (definition of person). The designated recipient is identified by the name of the person provided by the sender to the remittance transfer provider and disclosed by the provider to the sender pursuant to \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1)(iii).\r\n\r\n{30-c-Interp-2}\r\n2. *Location in a foreign country.*\r\n\r\n{30-c-Interp-2-i}\r\ni. A remittance transfer is received at a location in a foreign country if funds are to be received at a location physically outside of any State, as defined in \u00a7 1005.2(l). A specific pick-up location need not be designated for funds to be received at a location in a foreign country. If it is specified that the funds will be transferred to a foreign country to be picked up by the designated recipient, the transfer will be received at a location in a foreign country, even though a specific pick-up location within that country has not been designated. If it is specified that the funds will be received at a location on a U.S. military installation that is physically located in a foreign country, the transfer will be received in a State.\r\n\r\n{30-c-Interp-2-ii}\r\nii. For transfers to a designated recipient's account, whether funds are to be received at a location physically outside of any State depends on where the recipient's account is located. If the account is located in a State, the funds will not be received at a location in a foreign country. Accounts that are located on a U.S. military installation that is physically located in a foreign country are located in a State.\r\n\r\n{30-c-Interp-2-iii}\r\niii. Where the sender does not specify information about a designated recipient's account, but instead provides information about the recipient, a remittance transfer provider may make the determination of whether the funds will be received at a location in a foreign country on information that is provided by the sender, and other information the provider may have, at the time the transfer is requested. For example, if a consumer in a State gives a provider the recipient's email address, and the provider has no other information about whether the funds will be received by the recipient at a location in a foreign country, then the provider may determine that funds are not to be received at a location in a foreign country. However, if the provider at the time the transfer is requested has additional information indicating that funds are to be received in a foreign country, such as if the recipient's email address is already registered with the provider and associated with a foreign account, then the provider has sufficient information to conclude that the remittance transfer will be received at a location in a foreign country. Similarly, if a consumer in a State purchases a prepaid card, and the provider mails or delivers the card directly to the consumer, the provider may conclude that funds are not to be received in a foreign country, because the provider does not know whether the consumer will subsequently send the prepaid card to a recipient in a foreign country. In contrast, the provider has sufficient information to conclude that the funds are to be received in a foreign country if the remittance transfer provider sends a prepaid card to a specified recipient in a foreign country, even if a person located in a State, including the sender, retains the ability to access funds on the prepaid card.\r\n\r\n{30-c-Interp-3}\r\n3. *Sender as designated recipient.* A \u201csender,\u201d as defined in \u00a7 1005.30(g), may also be a designated recipient if the sender meets the definition of \u201cdesignated recipient\u201d in \u00a7 1005.30(c). For example, a sender may request that a provider send an electronic transfer of funds from the sender's checking account in a State to the sender's checking account located in a foreign country. In this case, the sender would also be a designated recipient.\r\n\r\n{30-d-Interp}\r\n#### 30(d) Preauthorized Remittance Transfer\r\n\r\n{30-d-Interp-1}\r\n1. *Advance authorization.* A preauthorized remittance transfer is a remittance transfer authorized in advance of a transfer that will take place on a recurring basis, at substantially regular intervals, and will require no further action by the consumer to initiate the transfer. In a bill-payment system, for example, if the consumer authorizes a remittance transfer provider to make monthly payments to a payee by means of a remittance transfer, and the payments take place without further action by the consumer, the payments are preauthorized remittance transfers. In contrast, if the consumer must take action each month to initiate a transfer (such as by entering instructions on a telephone or home computer), the payments are not preauthorized remittance transfers.\r\n\r\n{30-e-Interp}\r\n#### 30(e) Remittance Transfer\r\n\r\n{30-e-Interp-1}\r\n1. *Electronic transfer of funds.* The definition of \u201cremittance transfer\u201d requires an electronic transfer of funds. The term electronic has the meaning given in section 106(2) of the Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act. There may be an electronic transfer of funds if a provider makes an electronic book entry between different settlement accounts to effectuate the transfer. However, where a sender mails funds directly to a recipient, or provides funds to a courier for delivery to a foreign country, there is not an electronic transfer of funds. Similarly, generally, where a provider issues a check, draft, or other paper instrument to be mailed to a person abroad, there is not an electronic transfer of funds. Nonetheless, an electronic transfer of funds occurs for a payment made by a provider under a bill-payment service available to a consumer via computer or other electronic means, unless the terms of the bill-payment service explicitly state that all payments, or all payments to a particular payee or payees, will be solely by check, draft, or similar paper instrument drawn on the consumer's account to be mailed abroad, and the payee or payees that will be paid in this manner are identified to the consumer. With respect to such a bill-payment service, if a provider provides a check, draft or similar paper instrument drawn on a consumer's account to be mailed abroad for a payee that is not identified to the consumer as described above, this payment by check, draft or similar payment instrument will be an electronic transfer of funds.\r\n\r\n{30-e-Interp-2}\r\n2. *Sent by a remittance transfer provider.*\r\n\r\n{30-e-Interp-2-i}\r\ni. The definition of \u201cremittance transfer\u201d requires that a transfer be \u201csent by a remittance transfer provider.\u201d This means that there must be an intermediary that is directly engaged with the sender to send an electronic transfer of funds on behalf of the sender to a designated recipient.\r\n\r\n{30-e-Interp-2-ii}\r\nii. A payment card network or other third party payment service that is functionally similar to a payment card network does not send a remittance transfer when a consumer provides a debit, credit or prepaid card directly to a foreign merchant as payment for goods or services. In such a case, the payment card network or third party payment service is not directly engaged with the sender to send a transfer of funds to a person in a foreign country; rather, the network or third party payment service is merely providing contemporaneous third-party payment processing and settlement services on behalf of the merchant or the card issuer, rather than on behalf of the sender. In such a case, the card issuer also is not directly engaged with the sender to send an electronic transfer of funds to the foreign merchant when the card issuer provides payment to the merchant. Similarly, where a consumer provides a checking or other account number, or a debit, credit or prepaid card, directly to a foreign merchant as payment for goods or services, the merchant is not acting as an intermediary that sends a transfer of funds on behalf of the sender when it submits the payment information for processing.\r\n\r\n{30-e-Interp-2-iii}\r\niii. However, a card issuer or a payment network may offer a service to a sender where the card issuer or a payment network is an intermediary that is directly engaged with the sender to obtain funds using the sender's debit, prepaid or credit card and to send those funds to a recipient's checking account located in a foreign country. In this case, the card issuer or the payment network is an intermediary that is directly engaged with the sender to send an electronic transfer of funds on behalf of the sender, and this transfer of funds is a remittance transfer because it is made to a designated recipient. *See* comment 30(c)-2.ii.\r\n\r\n{30-e-Interp-3}\r\n3. *Examples of remittance transfers.*\r\n\r\n{30-e-Interp-3-i}\r\ni. Examples of remittance transfers include:\r\n\r\n{30-e-Interp-3-i-A}\r\nA. Transfers where the sender provides cash or another method of payment to a money transmitter or financial institution and requests that funds be sent to a specified location or account in a foreign country.\r\n\r\n{30-e-Interp-3-i-B}\r\nB. Consumer wire transfers, where a financial institution executes a payment order upon a sender's request to wire money from the sender's account to a designated recipient.\r\n\r\n{30-e-Interp-3-i-C}\r\nC. An addition of funds to a prepaid card by a participant in a prepaid card program, such as a prepaid card issuer or its agent, that is directly engaged with the sender to add these funds, where the prepaid card is sent or was previously sent by a participant in the prepaid card program to a person in a foreign country, even if a person located in a State (including a sender) retains the ability to withdraw such funds.\r\n\r\n{30-e-Interp-3-i-D}\r\nD. International ACH transactions sent by the sender's financial institution at the sender's request.\r\n\r\n{30-e-Interp-3-i-E}\r\nE. Online bill payments and other electronic transfers that a sender schedules in advance, including preauthorized remittance transfers, made by the sender's financial institution at the sender's request to a designated recipient.\r\n\r\n{30-e-Interp-3-ii}\r\nii. The term remittance transfer does not include, for example:\r\n\r\n{30-e-Interp-3-ii-A}\r\nA. A consumer's provision of a debit, credit or prepaid card, directly to a foreign merchant as payment for goods or services because the issuer is not directly engaged with the sender to send an electronic transfer of funds to the foreign merchant when the issuer provides payment to the merchant. *See* comment 30(e)-2.\r\n\r\n{30-e-Interp-3-ii-B}\r\nB. A consumer's deposit of funds to a checking or savings account located in a State, because there has not been a transfer of funds to a designated recipient. *See* comment 30(c)-2.ii.\r\n\r\n{30-e-Interp-3-ii-C}\r\nC. Online bill payments and other electronic transfers that senders can schedule in advance, including preauthorized transfers, made through the Web site of a merchant located in a foreign country and via direct provision of a checking account, credit card, debit card or prepaid card number to the merchant, because the financial institution is not directly engaged with the sender to send an electronic transfer of funds to the foreign merchant when the institution provides payment to the merchant. *See* comment 30(e)-2.\r\n\r\n{30-f-Interp}\r\n#### 30(f) Remittance Transfer Provider\r\n\r\n{30-f-Interp-1}\r\n1. *Agents.* A person is not deemed to be acting as a remittance transfer provider when it performs activities as an agent on behalf of a remittance transfer provider.\r\n\r\n{30-f-Interp-2}\r\n2. *Normal course of business.*\r\n\r\n{30-f-Interp-2-i}\r\ni. *General.* Whether a person provides remittance transfers in the normal course of business depends on the facts and circumstances, including the total number and frequency of remittance transfers sent by the provider. For example, if a financial institution generally does not make remittance transfers available to customers, but sends a couple of such transfers in a given year as an accommodation for a customer, the institution does not provide remittance transfers in the normal course of business. In contrast, if a financial institution makes remittance transfers generally available to customers (whether described in the institution's deposit account agreement, or in practice) and makes transfers many times per month, the institution provides remittance transfers in the normal course of business.\r\n\r\n{30-f-Interp-2-ii}\r\nii. *Safe harbor.* Under \u00a7 1005.30(f)(2)(i), a person that provided 100 or fewer remittance transfers in the previous calendar year and provides 100 or fewer remittance transfers in the current calendar year is deemed not to be providing remittance transfers in the normal course of its business. Accordingly, a person that qualifies for the safe harbor in \u00a7 1005.30(f)(2)(i) is not a \u201cremittance transfer provider\u201d and is not subject to the requirements of subpart B. For purposes of determining whether a person qualifies for the safe harbor under \u00a7 1005.30(f)(2)(i), the number of remittance transfers provided includes any transfers excluded from the definition of \u201cremittance transfer\u201d due simply to the safe harbor. In contrast, the number of remittance transfers provided does not include any transfers that are excluded from the definition of \u201cremittance transfer\u201d for reasons other than the safe harbor, such as small value transactions or securities and commodities transfers that are excluded from the definition of \u201cremittance transfer\u201d by \u00a7 1005.30(e)(2).\r\n\r\n{30-f-Interp-2-iii}\r\niii. *Transition period.* A person may cease to satisfy the requirements of the safe harbor described in \u00a7 1005.30(f)(2)(i) if the person provides in excess of 100 remittance transfers in a calendar year. For example, if a person that provided 100 or fewer remittance transfers in the previous calendar year provides more than 100 remittance transfers in the current calendar year, the safe harbor applies to the first 100 remittance transfers that the person provides in the current calendar year. For any additional remittance transfers provided in the current calendar year and for any remittance transfers provided in the subsequent calendar year, whether the person provides remittance transfers for a consumer in the normal course of its business, as defined in \u00a7 1005.30(f)(1), and is thus a remittance transfer provider for those additional transfers, depends on the facts and circumstances. Section 1005.30(f)(2)(ii) provides a reasonable period of time, not to exceed six months, for such a person to begin complying with subpart B, if that person is then providing remittance transfers in the normal course of its business. At the end of that reasonable period of time, such person would be required to comply with subpart B unless, based on the facts and circumstances, the person is not a remittance transfer provider.\r\n\r\n{30-f-Interp-2-iv}\r\niv. *Example of safe harbor and transition period.* Assume that a person provided 90 remittance transfers in 2012 and 90 such transfers in 2013. The safe harbor will apply to the person's transfers in 2013, as well as the person's first 100 remittance transfers in 2014. However, if the person provides a 101st transfer on September 5, the facts and circumstances determine whether the person provides remittance transfers in the normal course of business and is thus a remittance transfer provider for the 101st and any subsequent remittance transfers that it provides in 2014. Furthermore, the person would not qualify for the safe harbor described in \u00a7 1005.30(f)(2)(i) in 2015 because the person did not provide 100 or fewer remittance transfers in 2014. However, for the 101st remittance transfer provided in 2014, as well as additional remittance transfers provided thereafter in 2014 and 2015, if that person is then providing remittance transfers for a consumer in the normal course of business, the person will have a reasonable period of time, not to exceed six months, to come into compliance with subpart B. Assume that in this case, a reasonable period of time is six months. Thus, compliance with subpart B is not required for remittance transfers made on or before March 5, 2015 ( *i.e.,* six months after September 5, 2014). After March 5, 2015, the person is required to comply with subpart B if, based on the facts and circumstances, the person provides remittance transfers in the normal course of business and is thus a remittance transfer provider.\r\n\r\n{30-f-Interp-3}\r\n3. *Multiple remittance transfer providers.* If the remittance transfer involves more than one remittance transfer provider, only one set of disclosures must be given, and the remittance transfer providers must agree among themselves which provider must take the actions necessary to comply with the requirements that subpart B imposes on any or all of them. Even though the providers must designate one provider to take the actions necessary to comply with the requirements that subpart B imposes on any or all of them, all remittance transfer providers involved in the remittance transfer remain responsible for compliance with the applicable provisions of the EFTA and Regulation E.\r\n\r\n{30-g-Interp}\r\n#### 30(g) Sender\r\n\r\n{30-g-Interp-1}\r\n1. *Determining whether a consumer is located in a State.* Under \u00a7 1005.30(g), the definition of \u201csender\u201d means a consumer in a State who, primarily for personal, family, or household purposes, requests a remittance transfer provider to send a remittance transfer to a designated recipient. A sender located on a U.S. military installation that is physically located in a foreign country is located in a State. For transfers from a consumer's account, whether a consumer is located in a State depends on where the consumer's account is located. If the account is located in a State, the consumer will be located in a State for purposes of the definition of \u201csender\u201d in \u00a7 1005.30(g), notwithstanding comment 3(a)-3. Accounts that are located on a U.S. military installation that is physically located in a foreign country are located in a State. Where a transfer is requested electronically or by telephone and the transfer is not from an account, the provider may make the determination of whether a consumer is located in a State based on information that is provided by the consumer and on any records associated with the consumer that the provider may have, such as an address provided by the consumer.\r\n\r\n{30-g-Interp-2}\r\n2. *Personal, family, or household purposes.* Under \u00a7 1005.30(g), a consumer is a \u201csender\u201d only where he or she requests a transfer primarily for personal, family, or household purposes. A consumer who requests a transfer primarily for other purposes, such as business or commercial purposes, is not a sender under \u00a7 1005.30(g). For transfers from an account that was established primarily for personal, family, or household purposes, a remittance transfer provider may generally deem that the transfer is requested primarily for personal, family, or household purposes and the consumer is therefore a \u201csender\u201d under \u00a7 1005.30(g). But if the consumer indicates that he or she is requesting the transfer primarily for other purposes, such as business or commercial purposes, then the consumer is not a sender under \u00a7 1005.30(g), even if the consumer is requesting the transfer from an account that is used primarily for personal, family, or household purposes.\r\n\r\n{30-g-Interp-3}\r\n3. *Non-consumer accounts.* A provider may deem that a transfer that is requested to be sent from an account that was not established primarily for personal, family, or household purposes, such as an account that was established as a business or commercial account or an account held by a business entity such as a corporation, not-for-profit corporation, professional corporation, limited liability company, partnership, or sole proprietorship, as not being requested primarily for personal, family, or household purposes. A consumer requesting a transfer from such an account therefore is not a sender under \u00a7 1005.30(g). Additionally, a transfer that is requested to be sent from an account held by a financial institution under a *bona fide* trust agreement pursuant to \u00a7 1005.2(b)(3) is not requested primarily for personal, family, or household purposes, and a consumer requesting a transfer from such an account is therefore not a sender under \u00a7 1005.30(g).\r\n\r\n{30-h-Interp}\r\n#### 30(h) Third-Party Fees\r\n\r\n{30-h-Interp-1}\r\n1. *Fees imposed on the remittance transfer.* Fees imposed on the remittance transfer by a person other than the remittance transfer provider include only those fees that are charged to the designated recipient and are specifically related to the remittance transfer. For example, overdraft fees that are imposed by a recipient's bank or funds that are garnished from the proceeds of a remittance transfer to satisfy an unrelated debt are not fees imposed on the remittance transfer because these charges are not specifically related to the remittance transfer. Account fees are also not specifically related to a remittance transfer if such fees are merely assessed based on general account activity and not for receiving transfers. Where an incoming remittance transfer results in a balance increase that triggers a monthly maintenance fee, that fee is not specifically related to a remittance transfer. Similarly, fees that banks charge one another for handling a remittance transfer or other fees that do not affect the total amount of the transaction or the amount that will be received by the designated recipient are not fees imposed on the remittance transfer. For example, an interchange fee that is charged to a provider when a sender uses a credit or debit card to pay for a remittance transfer is not a fee imposed upon the remittance transfer. Fees that specifically relate to a remittance transfer may be structured on a flat per-transaction basis, or may be conditioned on other factors (such as account status or the quantity of remittance transfers received) in addition to the remittance transfer itself. For example, where an institution charges an incoming transfer fee on most customers' accounts, but not on preferred accounts, such a fee is nonetheless specifically related to a remittance transfer. Similarly, if the institution assesses a fee for every transfer beyond the fifth received each month, such a fee would be specifically related to the remittance transfer regardless of how many remittance transfers preceded it that month.\r\n\r\n{30-h-Interp-2}\r\n2. *Covered third-party fees.*\r\n\r\n{30-h-Interp-2-i}\r\ni. Under \u00a7 1005.30(h)(1), a covered third-party fee means any fee that is imposed on the remittance transfer by a person other than the remittance transfer provider that is not a non-covered third-party fee.\r\n\r\n{30-h-Interp-2-ii}\r\nii. Examples of covered third-party fees include:\r\n\r\n{30-h-Interp-2-ii-A}\r\nA. Fees imposed on a remittance transfer by intermediary institutions in connection with a wire transfer (sometimes referred to as \u201clifting fees\u201d).\r\n\r\n{30-h-Interp-2-ii-B}\r\nB. Fees imposed on a remittance transfer by an agent of the provider at pick-up for receiving the transfer.\r\n\r\n{30-h-Interp-2-ii-3}\r\n3. *Non-covered third-party fees.* Under \u00a7 1005.30(h)(2), a non-covered third-party fee means any fee imposed by the designated recipient's institution for receiving a remittance transfer into an account except if such institution acts as the agent of the remittance transfer provider. For example, a fee imposed by the designated recipient's institution for receiving an incoming transfer into an account is a non-covered third-party fee, provided such institution is not acting as the agent of the remittance transfer provider. *See also* comment 31(b)(1)(viii)-1. Furthermore, designated recipient's account in \u00a7 1005.30(h)(2) refers to an asset account, regardless of whether it is a consumer asset account, established for any purpose and held by a bank, savings association, credit union, or equivalent institution. A designated recipient's account does not, however, include a credit card, prepaid card, or a virtual account held by an Internet-based or mobile telephone company that is not a bank, savings association, credit union or equivalent institution.\r\n\r\n{31-Interp}\r\n### Section 1005.31 - Disclosures\r\n\r\n{31-a-Interp}\r\n#### 31(a) General Form of Disclosures\r\n\r\n{31-a-1-Interp}\r\n#### 31(a)(1) Clear and Conspicuous\r\n\r\n{31-a-1-Interp-1}\r\n1. *Clear and conspicuous standard.* Disclosures are clear and conspicuous for purposes of subpart B if they are readily understandable and, in the case of written and electronic disclosures, the location and type size are readily noticeable to senders. Oral disclosures as permitted by \u00a7 1005.31(a)(3), (4), and (5) are clear and conspicuous when they are given at a volume and speed sufficient for a sender to hear and comprehend them.\r\n\r\n{31-a-1-Interp-2}\r\n2. *Abbreviations and symbols.* Disclosures may contain commonly accepted or readily understandable abbreviations or symbols, such as \u201cUSD\u201d to indicate currency in U.S. dollars or \u201cMXN\u201d to indicate currency in Mexican pesos.\r\n\r\n{31-a-2-Interp}\r\n#### 31(a)(2) Written and Electronic Disclosures\r\n\r\n{31-a-2-Interp-1}\r\n1. *E-Sign Act requirements.* If a sender electronically requests the remittance transfer provider to send a remittance transfer, the disclosures required by \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1) may be provided to the sender in electronic form without regard to the consumer consent and other applicable provisions of the Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act (E-Sign Act) (15 U.S.C. 7001 *et seq.*). If a sender electronically requests the provider to send a remittance transfer, the disclosures required by \u00a7 1005.31(b)(2) may be provided to the sender in electronic form, subject to compliance with the consumer consent and other applicable provisions of the E-Sign Act. *See* \u00a7 1005.4(a)(1).\r\n\r\n{31-a-2-Interp-2}\r\n2. *Paper size.* Written disclosures may be provided on any size paper, as long as the disclosures are clear and conspicuous. For example, disclosures may be provided on a register receipt or on an 8.5 inch by 11 inch sheet of paper.\r\n\r\n{31-a-2-Interp-3}\r\n3. *Retainable electronic disclosures.* A remittance transfer provider may satisfy the requirement to provide electronic disclosures in a retainable form if it provides an online disclosure in a format that is capable of being printed. Electronic disclosures may not be provided through a hyperlink or in another manner by which the sender can bypass the disclosure. A provider is not required to confirm that the sender has read the electronic disclosures.\r\n\r\n{31-a-2-Interp-4}\r\n4. *Pre-payment disclosures to a mobile telephone.* Disclosures provided via mobile application or text message, to the extent permitted by \u00a7 1005.31(a)(5), need not be retainable. However, disclosures provided electronically to a mobile telephone that are not provided via mobile application or text message must be retainable. For example, disclosures provided via email must be retainable, even if a sender accesses them by mobile telephone.\r\n\r\n{31-a-2-Interp-5}\r\n5. *Disclosures provided by fax.* For purposes of disclosures required to be provided pursuant to \u00a7 1005.31 or \u00a7 1005.36, disclosures provided by facsimile transmission ( *i.e.,* fax) are considered to be provided in writing for purposes of providing disclosures in writing pursuant to subpart B and are not subject to the requirements for electronic disclosures set forth in \u00a7 1005.31(a)(2).\r\n\r\n{31-a-3-Interp}\r\n#### 31(a)(3) Disclosures for Oral Telephone Transactions\r\n\r\n{31-a-3-Interp-1}\r\n1. *Transactions conducted partially by telephone.* Except as provided in comment 31(a)(3)-2, for transactions conducted partially by telephone, providing the information required by \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1) to a sender orally does not fulfill the requirement to provide the disclosures required by \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1). For example, a sender may begin a remittance transfer at a remittance transfer provider's dedicated telephone in a retail store, and then provide payment in person to a store clerk to complete the transaction. In such cases, all disclosures must be provided in writing. A provider complies with this requirement, for example, by providing the written pre-payment disclosure in person prior to the sender's payment for the transaction, and the written receipt when the sender pays for the transaction.\r\n\r\n{31-a-3-Interp-2}\r\n2. *Oral telephone transactions.* Section 1005.31(a)(3) applies to transactions conducted orally and entirely by telephone, such as transactions conducted orally on a landline or mobile telephone. A remittance transfer provider may treat a written or electronic communication as an inquiry when it believes that treating the communication as a request would be impractical. For example, if a sender physically located abroad contacts a U.S. branch of the sender's financial institution and attempts to initiate a remittance transfer by first sending a mailed letter, further communication with the sender by letter may be impractical due to the physical distance and likely mail delays. In such circumstances, a provider may conduct the transaction orally and entirely by telephone pursuant to \u00a7 1005.31(a)(3) when the provider treats that initial communication as an inquiry and subsequently responds to the consumer's inquiry by calling the consumer on a telephone and orally gathering or confirming the information needed to identify and understand a request for a remittance transfer and otherwise conducts the transaction orally and entirely by telephone.\r\n\r\n{31-a-5-Interp}\r\n#### 31(a)(5) Disclosures for Mobile Application or Text Message Transactions\r\n\r\n{31-a-5-Interp-1}\r\n1. *Mobile application and text message transactions.* A remittance transfer provider may provide the required pre-payment disclosures orally or via mobile application or text message if the transaction is conducted entirely by telephone via mobile application or text message, the remittance transfer provider complies with the requirements of \u00a7 1005.31(g)(2), and the provider discloses orally or via mobile application or text message a statement about the rights of the sender regarding cancellation required by \u00a7 1005.31(b)(2)(iv) pursuant to the timing requirements in \u00a7 1005.31(e)(1). For example, if a sender conducts a transaction via text message on a mobile telephone, the remittance transfer provider may call the sender and orally provide the required pre-payment disclosures. Alternatively, the provider may provide the required pre-payment disclosures via text message. Section 1005.31(a)(5) applies only to transactions conducted entirely by mobile telephone via mobile application or text message.\r\n\r\n{31-b-Interp}\r\n#### 31(b) Disclosure Requirements\r\n\r\n{31-b-Interp-1}\r\n1. *Disclosures provided as applicable.* Disclosures required by \u00a7 1005.31(b) need only be provided to the extent applicable. A remittance transfer provider may choose to omit an item of information required by \u00a7 1005.31(b) if it is inapplicable to a particular transaction. Alternatively, for disclosures required by \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1)(i) through (vii), a provider may disclose a term and state that an amount or item is \u201cnot applicable,\u201d \u201cN/A,\u201d or \u201cNone.\u201d For example, if fees or taxes are not imposed in connection with a particular transaction, the provider need not provide the disclosures about fees and taxes generally required by \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1)(ii), the disclosures about covered third-party fees generally required by \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1)(vi), or the disclaimers about non-covered third-party fees and taxes collected by a person other than the provider generally required by \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1)(viii). Similarly, a Web site need not be disclosed if the provider does not maintain a Web site. A provider need not provide the exchange rate disclosure required by \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1)(iv) if a recipient receives funds in the currency in which the remittance transfer is funded, or if funds are delivered into an account denominated in the currency in which the remittance transfer is funded. For example, if a sender in the United States sends funds from an account denominated in Euros to an account in France denominated in Euros, no exchange rate would need to be provided. Similarly, if a sender funds a remittance transfer in U.S. dollars and requests that a remittance transfer be delivered to the recipient in U.S. dollars, a provider need not disclose an exchange rate.\r\n\r\n{31-b-Interp-2}\r\n2. *Substantially similar terms, language, and notices.* Certain disclosures required by \u00a7 1005.31(b) must be described using the terms set forth in \u00a7 1005.31(b) or substantially similar terms. Terms may be more specific than those provided. For example, a remittance transfer provider sending funds may describe fees imposed by an agent at pick-up as \u201cPick-up Fees\u201d in lieu of describing them as \u201cOther Fees.\u201d Foreign language disclosures required under \u00a7 1005.31(g) must contain accurate translations of the terms, language, and notices required by \u00a7 1005.31(b) or permitted by \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1)(viii) and \u00a7 1005.33(h)(3).\r\n\r\n{31-b-1-Interp}\r\n#### 31(b)(1) Pre-Payment Disclosures\r\n\r\n{31-b-1-Interp-1}\r\n1. *Fees and taxes.*\r\n\r\n{31-b-1-Interp-1-i}\r\ni. Taxes collected on the remittance transfer by the remittance transfer provider include taxes collected on the remittance transfer by a State or other governmental body. A provider need only disclose fees imposed or taxes collected on the remittance transfer by the provider in \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1)(ii), as applicable. For example, if no transfer taxes are imposed on a remittance transfer, a provider would only disclose applicable transfer fees. *See* comment 31(b)-1. If both fees and taxes are imposed, the fees and taxes must be disclosed as separate, itemized disclosures. For example, a provider would disclose all transfer fees using the term \u201cTransfer Fees\u201d or a substantially similar term and would separately disclose all transfer taxes using the term \u201cTransfer Taxes\u201d or a substantially similar term.\r\n\r\n{31-b-1-Interp-1-ii}\r\nii. The fees and taxes required to be disclosed by \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1)(ii) include all fees imposed and all taxes collected on the remittance transfer by the provider. For example, a provider must disclose any service fee, any fees imposed by an agent of the provider at the time of the transfer, and any State taxes collected on the remittance transfer at the time of the transfer. Fees imposed on the remittance transfer by the provider required to be disclosed under \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1)(ii) include only those fees that are charged to the sender and are specifically related to the remittance transfer. *See also* comment 30(h)-1. In contrast, the fees required to be disclosed by \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1)(vi) are any covered third-party fees as defined in \u00a7 1005.30(h)(1).\r\n\r\n{31-b-1-Interp-1-iii}\r\niii. The term used to describe the fees imposed on the remittance transfer by the provider in \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1)(ii) and the term used to describe covered third-party fees under \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1)(vi) must differentiate between such fees. For example the terms used to describe fees disclosed under \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1)(ii) and (vi) may not both be described solely as \u201cFees.\u201d\r\n\r\n{31-b-1-Interp-2}\r\n2. *Transfer amount.* Sections 1005.31(b)(1)(i) and (v) require two transfer amount disclosures. First, under \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1)(i), a provider must disclose the transfer amount in the currency in which the remittance transfer is funded to show the calculation of the total amount of the transaction. Typically, the remittance transfer is funded in U.S. dollars, so the transfer amount would be expressed in U.S. dollars. However, if the remittance transfer is funded, for example, from a Euro-denominated account, the transfer amount would be expressed in Euros. Second, under \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1)(v), a provider must disclose the transfer amount in the currency in which the funds will be made available to the designated recipient. For example, if the funds will be picked up by the designated recipient in Japanese yen, the transfer amount would be expressed in Japanese yen. However, this second transfer amount need not be disclosed if covered third-party fees as described under \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1)(vi) are not imposed on the remittance transfer. The terms used to describe each transfer amount should be the same.\r\n\r\n{31-b-1-Interp-3}\r\n3. *Exchange rate for calculation.* The exchange rate used to calculate the transfer amount in \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1)(v), the covered third-party fees in \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1)(vi), the amount received in \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1)(vii), and the optional disclosures of non-covered third-party fees and other taxes permitted by \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1)(viii) is the exchange rate in \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1)(iv), including an estimated exchange rate to the extent permitted by \u00a7 1005.32, prior to any rounding of the exchange rate. For example, if one U.S. dollar exchanges for 11.9483779 Mexican pesos, a provider must calculate these disclosures using this rate, even though the provider may disclose pursuant to \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1)(iv) that the U.S. dollar exchanges for 11.9484 Mexican pesos. Similarly, if a provider estimates pursuant to \u00a7 1005.32 that one U.S. dollar exchanges for 11.9483 Mexican pesos, a provider must calculate these disclosures using this rate, even though the provider may disclose pursuant to \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1)(iv) that the U.S. dollar exchanges for 11.95 Mexican pesos (Estimated). If an exchange rate need not be rounded, a provider must use that exchange rate to calculate these disclosures. For example, if one U.S. dollar exchanges for exactly 11.9 Mexican pesos, a provider must calculate these disclosures using this exchange rate.\r\n\r\n{31-b-1-iv-Interp}\r\n#### 31(b)(1)(iv) Exchange Rate\r\n\r\n{31-b-1-iv-Interp-1}\r\n1. *Applicable exchange rate.* If the designated recipient will receive funds in a currency other than the currency in which the remittance transfer is funded, a remittance transfer provider must disclose the exchange rate to be used by the provider for the remittance transfer. An exchange rate that is estimated must be disclosed pursuant to the requirements of \u00a7 1005.32. A remittance transfer provider may not disclose, for example, that an exchange rate is \u201cunknown,\u201d \u201cfloating,\u201d or \u201cto be determined.\u201d If a provider does not have specific knowledge regarding the currency in which the funds will be received, the provider may rely on a sender's representation as to the currency in which funds will be received for purposes of determining whether an exchange rate is applied to the transfer. For example, if a sender requests that a remittance transfer be deposited into an account in U.S. dollars, the provider need not disclose an exchange rate, even if the account is actually denominated in Mexican pesos and the funds are converted prior to deposit into the account. If a sender does not know the currency in which funds will be received, the provider may assume that the currency in which funds will be received is the currency in which the remittance transfer is funded.\r\n\r\n{31-b-1-iv-Interp-2}\r\n2. *Rounding.* The exchange rate disclosed by the provider for the remittance transfer is required to be rounded. The provider may round to two, three, or four decimal places, at its option. For example, if one U.S. dollar exchanges for 11.9483779 Mexican pesos, a provider may disclose that the U.S. dollar exchanges for 11.9484 Mexican pesos. The provider may alternatively disclose, for example, that the U.S. dollar exchanges for 11.948 pesos or 11.95 pesos. On the other hand, if one U.S. dollar exchanges for exactly 11.9 Mexican pesos, the provider may disclose that \u201cUS$1 = 11.9 MXN\u201d in lieu of, for example, \u201cUS$1 = 11.90 MXN.\u201d The exchange rate disclosed for the remittance transfer must be rounded consistently for each currency. For example, a provider may not round to two decimal places for some transactions exchanged into Euros and round to four decimal places for other transactions exchanged into Euros.\r\n\r\n{31-b-1-iv-Interp-3}\r\n3. *Exchange rate used.* The exchange rate used by the provider for the remittance transfer need not be set by that provider. For example, an exchange rate set by an intermediary institution and applied to the remittance transfer would be the exchange rate used for the remittance transfer and must be disclosed by the provider.\r\n\r\n{31-b-1-vi-Interp}\r\n#### 31(b)(1)(vi) Disclosure of Covered Third-Party Fees\r\n\r\n{31-b-1-vi-Interp-1}\r\n1. *Fees disclosed in the currency in which the funds will be received.* Section 1005.31(b)(1)(vi) requires the disclosure of covered third-party fees in the currency in which the funds will be received by the designated recipient. A covered third-party fee described in \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1)(vi) may be imposed in one currency, but the funds may be received by the designated recipient in another currency. In such cases, the remittance transfer provider must calculate the fee to be disclosed under \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1)(vi) in the currency of receipt using the exchange rate in \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1)(iv), including an estimated exchange rate to the extent permitted by \u00a7 1005.32, prior to any rounding of the exchange rate. For example, an intermediary institution involved in sending an international wire transfer funded in U.S. dollars may impose a fee in U.S. dollars, but funds are ultimately deposited in the recipient's account in Euros. In this case, the provider would disclose the covered third-party fee to the sender expressed in Euros, calculated using the exchange rate disclosed under \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1)(iv), prior to any rounding of the exchange rate. For purposes of \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1)(v), (vi), and (vii), if a provider does not have specific knowledge regarding the currency in which the funds will be received, the provider may rely on a sender's representation as to the currency in which funds will be received. For example, if a sender requests that a remittance transfer be deposited into an account in U.S. dollars, the provider may provide the disclosures required in \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1)(v), (vi), and (vii) in U.S. dollars, even if the account is actually denominated in Mexican pesos and the funds are subsequently converted prior to deposit into the account. If a sender does not know the currency in which funds will be received, the provider may assume that the currency in which funds will be received is the currency in which the remittance transfer is funded.\r\n\r\n{31-b-1-vii-Interp}\r\n#### 31(b)(1)(vii) Amount Received\r\n\r\n{31-b-1-vii-Interp-1}\r\n *1. Amount received.* The remittance transfer provider is required to disclose the amount that will be received by the designated recipient in the currency in which the funds will be received. The amount received must reflect the exchange rate, all fees imposed and all taxes collected on the remittance transfer by the remittance transfer provider, as well as any covered third-party fees required to be disclosed by \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1)(vi). The disclosed amount received must be reduced by the amount of any fee or tax - except for a non-covered third-party fee or tax collected on the remittance transfer by a person other than the provider - that is imposed on the remittance transfer that affects the amount received even if that amount is imposed or itemized separately from the transaction amount.\r\n\r\n{31-b-1-viii-Interp}\r\n#### 31(b)(1)(viii) Statement When Additional Fees and Taxes May Apply\r\n\r\n{31-b-1-viii-Interp-1}\r\n1. *Required disclaimer when non-covered third-party fees and taxes collected by a person other than the provider may apply.* If non-covered third-party fees or taxes collected by a person other than the provider apply to a particular remittance transfer or if a provider does not know if such fees or taxes may apply to a particular remittance transfer, \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1)(viii) requires the provider to include the disclaimer with respect to such fees and taxes. Required disclosures under \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1)(viii) may only be provided to the extent applicable. For example, if the designated recipient's institution is an agent of the provider and thus, non-covered third-party fees cannot apply to the transfer, the provider must disclose all fees imposed on the remittance transfer and may not provide the disclaimer regarding non-covered third-party fees. In this scenario, the provider may only provide the disclaimer regarding taxes collected on the remittance transfer by a person other than the provider, as applicable. *See* Model Form A-30(c).\r\n\r\n{31-b-1-viii-Interp-2}\r\n2. *Optional disclosure of non-covered third-party fees and taxes collected by a person other than the provider.* When a remittance transfer provider knows the non-covered third-party fees or taxes collected on the remittance transfer by a person other than the provider that will apply to a particular transaction, \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1)(viii) permits the provider to disclose the amount of such fees and taxes. Section 1005.32(b)(3)-1 additionally permits a provider to disclose an estimate of such fees and taxes, provided any estimates are based on reasonable source of information. *See* comment 32(b)(3). For example, a provider may know that the designated recipient's institution imposes an incoming wire fee for receiving a transfer. Alternatively, a provider may know that foreign taxes will be collected on the remittance transfer by a person other than the remittance transfer provider. In these examples, the provider may choose, at its option, to disclose the amounts of the relevant recipient institution fee and tax as part of the information disclosed pursuant to \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1)(viii). The provider must not include that fee or tax in the amount disclosed pursuant to \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1)(vi) or (b)(1)(vii). Fees and taxes disclosed under \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1)(viii) must be disclosed in the currency in which the funds will be received. *See* comment 31(b)(1)(vi)-1. Estimates of any non-covered third-party fees and any taxes collected on the remittance transfer by a person other than the provider must be disclosed in accordance with \u00a7 1005.32(b)(3).\r\n\r\n{31-b-2-Interp}\r\n#### 31(b)(2) Receipt\r\n\r\n{31-b-2-Interp-1}\r\n1. *Date funds will be available.* A remittance transfer provider does not comply with the requirements of \u00a7 1005.31(b)(2)(ii) if it provides a range of dates that the remittance transfer may be available or an estimate of the date on which funds will be available. If a provider does not know the exact date on which funds will be available, the provider may disclose the latest date on which the funds will be available. For example, if funds may be available on January 3, but are not certain to be available until January 10, then a provider complies with \u00a7 1005.31(b)(2)(ii) if it discloses January 10 as the date funds will be available. However, a remittance transfer provider may also disclose that funds \u201cmay be available sooner\u201d or use a substantially similar term to inform senders that funds may be available to the designated recipient on a date earlier than the date disclosed. For example, a provider may disclose \u201cJanuary 10 (may be available sooner).\u201d\r\n\r\n{31-b-2-Interp-2}\r\n2. *Agencies required to be disclosed.* A remittance transfer provider must only disclose information about a State agency that licenses or charters the remittance transfer provider with respect to the remittance transfer as applicable. For example, if a financial institution is solely regulated by a Federal agency, and not licensed or chartered by a State agency, then the institution need not disclose information about a State agency. A remittance transfer provider must disclose information about the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, whether or not the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is the provider's primary Federal regulator.\r\n\r\n{31-b-2-Interp-3}\r\n3. *State agency that licenses or charters a provider.* A remittance transfer provider must only disclose information about one State agency that licenses or charters the remittance transfer provider with respect to the remittance transfer, even if other State agencies also regulate the remittance transfer provider. For example, a provider may disclose information about the State agency which granted its license. If a provider is licensed in multiple States, and the State agency that licenses the provider with respect to the remittance transfer is determined by a sender's location, a provider may make the determination as to the State in which the sender is located based on information that is provided by the sender and on any records associated with the sender. For example, if the State agency that licenses the provider with respect to an online remittance transfer is determined by a sender's location, a provider could rely on the sender's statement regarding the State in which the sender is located and disclose the State agency that licenses the provider in that State. A State-chartered bank must disclose information about the State agency that granted its charter, regardless of the location of the sender.\r\n\r\n{31-b-2-Interp-4}\r\n4. *Web site of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.* Section 1005.31(b)(2)(vi) requires a remittance transfer provider to disclose the name, toll-free telephone number(s), and Web site of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Providers may satisfy this requirement by disclosing the Web site of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's homepage, *www.consumerfinance.gov,* as shown on Model Forms A-32, A-34, A-35, and A-39. Alternatively, providers may, but are not required to, disclose the Bureau's Web site as the address of a page on the Bureau's Web site that provides information for consumers about remittance transfers, currently, *consumerfinance.gov/sending-money*, as shown on Model Form A-31. In addition, providers making disclosures in a language other than English pursuant to \u00a7 1005.31(g) may, but are not required to, disclose the Bureau's Web site as a page on the Bureau's Web site that provides information for consumers about remittance transfers in the relevant language, if such Web site exists. For example, a provider that is making disclosures in Spanish under \u00a7 1005.31(g) may, but is not required to, disclose the Bureau's Web site on Spanish-language disclosures as the page on the Bureau's Web site that provides information regarding remittance transfers in Spanish, currently *consumerfinance.gov/envios.* This optional disclosure is shown on Model A-40. The Bureau will publish a list of any other foreign language Web sites that provide information regarding remittance transfers.\r\n\r\n{31-b-2-Interp-5}\r\n5. *Date of transfer on receipt.* Where applicable, \u00a7 1005.31(b)(2)(vii) requires disclosure of the date of transfer for the remittance transfer that is the subject of a receipt required by \u00a7 1005.31(b)(2), including a receipt that is provided in accordance with the timing requirements in \u00a7 1005.36(a). For any subsequent preauthorized remittance transfer subject to \u00a7 1005.36(d)(2)(ii), the future date of transfer must be provided on any receipt provided for the initial transfer in that series of preauthorized remittance transfers, or where permitted, or disclosed as permitted by \u00a7 1005.31(a)(3) and (a)(5), in accordance with \u00a7 1005.36(a)(1)(i).\r\n\r\n{31-b-2-Interp-6}\r\n6. *Transfer date disclosures.* The following example demonstrates how the information required by \u00a7 1005.31(b)(2)(vii) and \u00a7 1005.36(d)(1) should be disclosed on receipts: On July 1, a sender instructs the provider to send a preauthorized remittance transfer of US$100 each week to a designated recipient. The sender requests that first transfer in the series be sent on July 15. On the receipt, the remittance transfer provider discloses an estimated exchange rate to the sender pursuant to \u00a7 1005.32(b)(2). In accordance with \u00a7 1005.31(b)(2)(vii), the provider should disclose the date of transfer for that particular transaction ( *i.e.,* July 15) on the receipt provided when payment is made for the transfer pursuant to the timing requirements in \u00a7 1005.36(a)(1)(i). The second receipt, which \u00a7 1005.36(a)(1)(ii) requires to be provided within one business day after the date of the transfer or, for transfers from the sender's account held by the provider, on the next regularly scheduled periodic statement or within 30 days after payment is made if a periodic statement is not provided, is also required to include the date of transfer. If the provider discloses on either receipt the cancellation period applicable to and dates of subsequent preauthorized remittance transfers in accordance with \u00a7 1005.36(d)(2), the disclosure must be phrased and formatted in such a way that it is clear to the sender which cancellation period is applicable to any date of transfer on the receipt.\r\n\r\n{31-b-2-Interp-7}\r\n7. *Cancellation disclosure.* Remittance transfer providers that offer remittance transfers scheduled three or more business days before the date of the transfer, as well as remittance transfers scheduled fewer than three business days before the date of the transfer, may meet the cancellation disclosure requirements in \u00a7 1005.31(b)(2)(iv) by describing the three-business-day and 30-minute cancellation periods on the same disclosure and using a checkbox or other method to clearly designate the applicable cancellation period. The provider may use a number of methods to indicate which cancellation period applies to the transaction including, but not limited to, a statement to that effect, use of a checkbox, highlighting, circling, and the like. For transfers scheduled three business days before the date of the transfer, the cancellation disclosures provided pursuant to \u00a7 1005.31(b)(2)(iv) should be phrased and formatted in such a way that it is clear to the sender which cancellation period is applicable to the date of transfer disclosed on the receipt.\r\n\r\n{31-b-3-Interp}\r\n#### 31(b)(3) Combined Disclosure\r\n\r\n{31-b-3-Interp-1}\r\n1. *Proof of payment.* If a sender initiating a remittance transfer receives a combined disclosure provided under \u00a7 1005.31(b)(3) and then completes the transaction, the remittance transfer provider must provide the sender with proof of payment. The proof of payment must be clear and conspicuous, provided in writing or electronically, and provided in a retainable form. The combined disclosure must be provided to the sender when the sender requests the remittance transfer, but prior to payment for the transfer, pursuant to \u00a7 1005.31(e)(1), and the proof of payment must be provided when payment is made for the remittance transfer. The proof of payment for the transaction may be provided on the same piece of paper as the combined disclosure or on a separate piece of paper. For example, a provider may feed a combined disclosure through a computer printer when payment is made to add the date and time of the transaction, a confirmation code, and an indication that the transfer was paid in full. A provider may also provide this additional information to a sender on a separate piece of paper when payment is made. A remittance transfer provider does not comply with the requirements of \u00a7 1005.31(b)(3) by providing a combined disclosure with no further indication that payment has been received.\r\n\r\n{31-b-3-Interp-2}\r\n2. *Confirmation of scheduling.* As discussed in comment 31(e)-2, payment is considered to be made when payment is authorized for purposes of various timing requirements in subpart B, including with regard to the timing requirement for provision of the proof of payment described in \u00a7 1005.31(b)(3)(i). However, where a transfer (whether a one-time remittance transfer or the first in a series of preauthorized remittance transfers) is scheduled before the date of transfer and the provider does not intend to process payment until at or near the date of transfer, the provider may provide a confirmation of scheduling in lieu of the proof of payment required by \u00a7 1005.31(b)(3)(i). No further proof of payment is required when payment is later processed.\r\n\r\n{31-c-Interp}\r\n#### 31(c) Specific Format Requirements\r\n\r\n{31-c-1-Interp}\r\n#### 31(c)(1) Grouping\r\n\r\n{31-c-1-Interp-1}\r\n1. *Grouping.* Information is grouped together for purposes of subpart B if multiple disclosures are in close proximity to one another and a sender can reasonably calculate the total amount of the transaction and the amount that will be received by the designated recipient. Model Forms A-30(a)-(d) through A-35 in Appendix A illustrate how information may be grouped to comply with the rule, but a remittance transfer provider may group the information in another manner. For example, a provider could provide the grouped information as a horizontal, rather than a vertical, calculation. A provider could also send multiple text messages sequentially to provide the full disclosure.\r\n\r\n{31-c-4-Interp}\r\n#### 31(c)(4) Segregation\r\n\r\n{31-c-4-Interp-1}\r\n1. *Segregation.* Disclosures may be segregated from other information in a variety of ways. For example, the disclosures may appear on a separate sheet of paper or may appear on the front of a page where other information appears on the back of that page. The disclosures may be set off from other information on a notice by outlining them in a box or series of boxes, with bold print dividing lines or a different color background, or by using other means.\r\n\r\n{31-c-4-Interp-2}\r\n2. *Directly related.* For purposes of \u00a7 1005.31(c)(4), the following is directly related information:\r\n\r\n{31-c-4-Interp-2-i}\r\ni. The date and time of the transaction;\r\n\r\n{31-c-4-Interp-2-ii}\r\nii. The sender's name and contact information;\r\n\r\n{31-c-4-Interp-2-iii}\r\niii. The location at which the designated recipient may pick up the funds;\r\n\r\n{31-c-4-Interp-2-iv}\r\niv. The confirmation or other identification code;\r\n\r\n{31-c-4-Interp-2-v}\r\nv. A company name and logo;\r\n\r\n{31-c-4-Interp-2-vi}\r\nvi. An indication that a disclosure is or is not a receipt or other indicia of proof of payment;\r\n\r\n{31-c-4-Interp-2-vii}\r\nvii. A designated area for signatures or initials;\r\n\r\n{31-c-4-Interp-2-viii}\r\nviii. A statement that funds may be available sooner, as permitted by \u00a7 1005.31(b)(2)(ii);\r\n\r\n{31-c-4-Interp-2-ix}\r\nix. Instructions regarding the retrieval of funds, such as the number of days the funds will be available to the recipient before they are returned to the sender; and\r\n\r\n{31-c-4-Interp-2-x}\r\nx. A statement that the provider makes money from foreign currency exchange.\r\n\r\n{31-c-4-Interp-2-xi}\r\nxi. Disclosure of any non-covered third-party fees and any taxes collected by a person other than the provider pursuant to \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1)(viii).\r\n\r\n{31-d-Interp}\r\n#### 31(d) Estimates\r\n\r\n{31-d-Interp-1}\r\n1. *Terms.* A remittance transfer provider may provide estimates of the amounts required by \u00a7 1005.31(b), to the extent permitted by \u00a7 1005.32. An estimate must be described using the term \u201cEstimated\u201d or a substantially similar term in close proximity to the term or terms described. For example, a remittance transfer provider could describe an estimated disclosure as \u201cEstimated Transfer Amount,\u201d \u201cOther Estimated Fees and Taxes,\u201d or \u201cTotal to Recipient (Est.).\u201d\r\n\r\n{31-e-Interp}\r\n#### 31(e) Timing\r\n\r\n{31-e-Interp-1}\r\n1. *Request to send a remittance transfer.* Except as provided in \u00a7 1005.36(a), pre-payment and combined disclosures are required to be provided to the sender when the sender requests the remittance transfer, but prior to payment for the transfer. Whether a consumer has requested a remittance transfer depends on the facts and circumstances. A sender that asks a provider to send a remittance transfer, and provides transaction-specific information to the provider in order to send funds to a designated recipient, has requested a remittance transfer. A sender that has sent an email, fax, mailed letter, or similar written or electronic communication has not requested a remittance transfer if the provider believes that it is impractical for the provider to treat that communication as a request and if the provider treats the communication as an inquiry and subsequently responds to that inquiry by calling the consumer on a telephone and orally gathering or confirming the information needed to process a request for a remittance transfer. *See* comment 31(a)(3)-2. Likewise, a consumer who solely inquires about that day's rates and fees to send to Mexico has not requested the provider to send a remittance transfer. Conversely, a sender who asks the provider at an agent location to send money to a recipient in Mexico and provides the sender and recipient information to the provider has requested a remittance transfer.\r\n\r\n{31-e-Interp-2}\r\n2. *When payment is made.* Except as provided in \u00a7 1005.36(a), a receipt required by \u00a7 1005.31(b)(2) must be provided to the sender when payment is made for the remittance transfer. For example, a remittance transfer provider could give the sender the disclosures after the sender pays for the remittance transfer, but before the sender leaves the counter. A provider could also give the sender the disclosures immediately before the sender pays for the transaction. For purposes of subpart B, payment is made, for example, when a sender provides cash to the remittance transfer provider or when payment is authorized.\r\n\r\n{31-e-Interp-3}\r\n3. *Telephone transfer from an account.* A sender may transfer funds from his or her account, as defined by \u00a7 1005.2(b), that is held by the remittance transfer provider. For example, a financial institution may send an international wire transfer for a sender using funds from the sender's account with the institution. Except as provided in \u00a7 1005.36(a), if the sender conducts such a transfer entirely by telephone, the institution may provide a receipt required by \u00a7 1005.31(b)(2) on or with the sender's next regularly scheduled periodic statement for that account or within 30 days after payment is made for the remittance transfer if a periodic statement is not provided.\r\n\r\n{31-e-Interp-4}\r\n4. *Mobile application and text message transactions.* If a transaction is conducted entirely by telephone via mobile application or text message, a receipt required by \u00a7 1005.31(b)(2) may be mailed or delivered to the sender pursuant to the timing requirements in \u00a7 1005.31(e)(2). For example, if a sender conducts a transfer entirely by telephone via mobile application, a remittance transfer provider may mail or deliver the disclosures to a sender pursuant to the timing requirements in \u00a7 1005.31(e)(2).\r\n\r\n{31-e-Interp-5}\r\n5. *Statement about cancellation rights.* The statement about the rights of the sender regarding cancellation required by \u00a7 1005.31(b)(2)(iv) may, but need not, be disclosed pursuant to the timing requirements of \u00a7 1005.31(e)(2) if a provider discloses this information pursuant to \u00a7 1005.31(a)(3)(iii) or (a)(5)(iii). The statement about the rights of the sender regarding error resolution required by \u00a7 1005.31(b)(2)(iv), however, must be disclosed pursuant to the timing requirements of \u00a7 1005.31(e)(2).\r\n\r\n{31-f-Interp}\r\n#### 31(f) Accurate When Payment Is Made\r\n\r\n{31-f-Interp-1}\r\n1. *No guarantee of disclosures provided before payment.* Except as provided in \u00a7 1005.36(b), disclosures required by \u00a7 1005.31(b) or permitted by \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1)(viii) must be accurate when a sender makes payment for the remittance transfer. A remittance transfer provider is not required to guarantee the terms of the remittance transfer in the disclosures required or permitted by \u00a7 1005.31(b) for any specific period of time. However, if any of the disclosures required by \u00a7 1005.31(b) or permitted by \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1)(viii) are not accurate when a sender makes payment for the remittance transfer, a provider must give new disclosures before accepting payment.\r\n\r\n{31-g-Interp}\r\n#### 31(g) Foreign Language Disclosures\r\n\r\n{31-g-Interp-1}\r\n1. *Number of foreign languages used in written disclosure.* Section 1005.31(g)(1) does not limit the number of languages that may be used on a single document, but such disclosures must be clear and conspicuous pursuant to \u00a7 1005.31(a)(1). Under \u00a7 1005.31(g)(1), a remittance transfer provider may, but need not, provide the sender with a written or electronic disclosure that is in English and, if applicable, in each foreign language that the remittance transfer provider principally uses to advertise, solicit, or market either orally, in writing, or electronically, at the office in which a sender conducts a transaction or asserts an error, respectively. Alternatively, the remittance transfer provider may provide the disclosure solely in English and, if applicable, the foreign language primarily used by the sender with the remittance transfer provider to conduct the transaction or assert an error, provided such language is principally used by the remittance transfer provider to advertise, solicit, or market either orally, in writing, or electronically, at the office in which the sender conducts the transaction or asserts the error, respectively. If the remittance transfer provider chooses the alternative method, it may provide disclosures in a single document with both languages or in two separate documents with one document in English and the other document in the applicable foreign language. The following examples illustrate this concept.\r\n\r\n{31-g-Interp-1-i}\r\ni. A remittance transfer provider principally uses only Spanish and Vietnamese to advertise, solicit, or market remittance transfer services at a particular office. The remittance transfer provider may provide all senders with disclosures in English, Spanish, and Vietnamese, regardless of the language the sender uses with the remittance transfer provider to conduct the transaction or assert an error.\r\n\r\n{31-g-Interp-1-ii}\r\nii. Same facts as i. If a sender primarily uses Spanish with the remittance transfer provider to conduct a transaction or assert an error, the remittance transfer provider may provide a written or electronic disclosure in English and Spanish, whether in a single document or two separate documents. If the sender primarily uses English with the remittance transfer provider to conduct the transaction or assert an error, the remittance transfer provider may provide a written or electronic disclosure solely in English. If the sender primarily uses a foreign language with the remittance transfer provider to conduct the transaction or assert an error that the remittance transfer provider does not use to advertise, solicit, or market either orally, in writing, or electronically, at the office in which the sender conducts the transaction or asserts the error, respectively, the remittance transfer provider may provide a written or electronic disclosure solely in English.\r\n\r\n{31-g-Interp-2}\r\n2. *Primarily used.* The language primarily used by the sender with the remittance transfer provider to conduct the transaction is the primary language used by the sender with the remittance transfer provider to convey the information necessary to complete the transaction. Similarly, the language primarily used by the sender with the remittance transfer provider to assert the error is the primary language used by the sender with the remittance transfer provider to provide the information required by \u00a7 1005.33(b) to assert an error. For example:\r\n\r\n{31-g-Interp-2-i}\r\ni. A sender initiates a conversation with a remittance transfer provider with a greeting in English and expresses interest in sending a remittance transfer to Mexico in English. If the remittance transfer provider thereafter communicates with the sender in Spanish and the sender conveys the other information needed to complete the transaction, including the designated recipient's information and the amount and funding source of the transfer, in Spanish, then Spanish is the language primarily used by the sender with the remittance transfer provider to conduct the transaction.\r\n\r\n{31-g-Interp-2-ii}\r\nii. A sender initiates a conversation with the remittance transfer provider with a greeting in English and states in English that there was a problem with a prior remittance transfer to Vietnam. If the remittance transfer provider thereafter communicates with the sender in Vietnamese and the sender uses Vietnamese to convey the information required by \u00a7 1005.33(b) to assert an error, then Vietnamese is the language primarily used by the sender with the remittance transfer provider to assert the error.\r\n\r\n{31-g-Interp-2-iii}\r\niii. A sender accesses the Web site of a remittance transfer provider that may be used by senders to conduct remittance transfers or assert errors. The Web site is offered in English and French. If the sender uses the French version of the Web site to conduct the remittance transfer, then French is the language primarily used by the sender with the remittance transfer provider to conduct the transaction.\r\n\r\n{31-g-1-Interp}\r\n#### 31(g)(1) General\r\n\r\n{31-g-1-Interp-1}\r\n1. *Principally used.*\r\n\r\n{31-g-1-Interp-1-i}\r\ni. All relevant facts and circumstances determine whether a foreign language is principally used by the remittance transfer provider to advertise, solicit, or market under \u00a7 1005.31(g)(1). Generally, whether a foreign language is considered to be principally used by the remittance transfer provider to advertise, solicit, or market is based on:\r\n\r\n{31-g-1-Interp-1-i-A}\r\nA. The frequency with which the foreign language is used in advertising, soliciting, or marketing of remittance transfer services at that office;\r\n\r\n{31-g-1-Interp-1-i-B}\r\nB. The prominence of the advertising, soliciting, or marketing of remittance transfer services in that foreign language at that office; and\r\n\r\n{31-g-1-Interp-1-i-C}\r\nC. The specific foreign language terms used in the advertising soliciting, or marketing of remittance transfer service at that office.\r\n\r\n{31-g-1-Interp-1-ii}\r\nii. For example, if a remittance transfer provider posts several prominent advertisements in a foreign language for remittance transfer services, including rate and fee information, on a consistent basis in an office, the provider is creating an expectation that a consumer could receive information on remittance transfer services in the foreign language used in the advertisements. The foreign language used in such advertisements would be considered to be principally used at that office based on the frequency and prominence of the advertising. In contrast, an advertisement for remittance transfer services, including rate and fee information, that is featured prominently at an office and is entirely in English, except for a greeting in a foreign language, does not create an expectation that a consumer could receive information on remittance transfer services in the foreign language used for such greeting. The foreign language used in such an advertisement is not considered to be principally used at that office based on the incidental specific foreign language term used.\r\n\r\n{31-g-1-Interp-2}\r\n2. *Advertise, solicit, or market.*\r\n\r\n{31-g-1-Interp-2-i}\r\ni. Any commercial message in a foreign language, appearing in any medium, that promotes directly or indirectly the availability of remittance transfer services constitutes advertising, soliciting, or marketing in such foreign language for purposes of \u00a7 1005.31(g)(1). Examples illustrating when a foreign language is used to advertise, solicit, or market include:\r\n\r\n{31-g-1-Interp-2-i-A}\r\nA. Messages in a foreign language in a leaflet or promotional flyer at an office.\r\n\r\n{31-g-1-Interp-2-i-B}\r\nB. Announcements in a foreign language on a public address system at an office.\r\n\r\n{31-g-1-Interp-2-i-C}\r\nC. On-line messages in a foreign language, such as on the internet.\r\n\r\n{31-g-1-Interp-2-i-D}\r\nD. Printed material in a foreign language on any exterior or interior sign at an office.\r\n\r\n{31-g-1-Interp-2-i-E}\r\nE. Point-of-sale displays in a foreign language at an office.\r\n\r\n{31-g-1-Interp-2-i-F}\r\nF. Telephone solicitations in a foreign language.\r\n\r\n{31-g-1-Interp-2-ii}\r\nii. Examples illustrating use of a foreign language for purposes other than to advertise, solicit, or market include:\r\n\r\n{31-g-1-Interp-2-ii-A}\r\nA. Communicating in a foreign language (whether by telephone, electronically, or otherwise) about remittance transfer services in response to a consumer-initiated inquiry.\r\n\r\n{31-g-1-Interp-2-ii-B}\r\nB. Making disclosures in a foreign language that are required by Federal or other applicable law.\r\n\r\n{31-g-1-Interp-3}\r\n3. *Office.* An office includes any physical location, telephone number, or Web site of a remittance transfer provider where a sender may conduct a remittance transfer or assert an error for a remittance transfer. The location need not exclusively offer remittance transfer services. For example, if an agent of a remittance transfer provider is located in a grocery store, the grocery store is considered an office for purposes of \u00a7 1005.31(g)(1). Because a consumer must be located in a State in order to be considered a \u201csender\u201d under \u00a7 1005.30(g), a Web site is not an office for purposes of \u00a7 1005.31(g)(1), even if the Web site can be accessed by consumers that are located in the United States, unless a sender may conduct a remittance transfer on the Web site or may assert an error for a remittance transfer on the Web site.\r\n\r\n{31-g-1-Interp-4}\r\n4. *At the office.* Any advertisement, solicitation, or marketing is considered to be made at the office in which a sender conducts a transaction or asserts an error if such advertisement, solicitation, or marketing is posted, provided, or made: at a physical office of a remittance transfer provider; on a Web site of a remittance transfer provider that may be used by senders to conduct remittance transfers or assert errors; during a telephone call with a remittance transfer provider that may be used by senders to conduct remittance transfers or assert errors; or via mobile application or text message by a remittance transfer provider if the mobile application or text message may be used by senders to conduct remittance transfers or assert errors. An advertisement, solicitation, or marketing that is considered to be made at an office does not include general advertisements, solicitations, or marketing that are not intended to be made at a particular office. For example, if an advertisement for remittance transfers in Chinese appears in a Chinese newspaper that is being distributed at a grocery store in which the agent of a remittance transfer provider is located, such advertisement would not be considered to be made at that office. For disclosures provided pursuant to \u00a7 1005.31, the relevant office is the office in which the sender conducts the transaction. For disclosures provided pursuant to \u00a7 1005.33 for error resolution purposes, the relevant office is the office in which the sender first asserts the error, not the office where the transaction was conducted.\r\n\r\n{32-Interp}\r\n### Section 1005.32 - Estimates\r\n\r\n{32-Interp-1}\r\n1. *Disclosures where estimates can be used.* Sections 1005.32(a) and (b)(1) permit estimates to be used in certain circumstances for disclosures described in \u00a7\u00a7 1005.31(b)(1) through (3) and 1005.36(a)(1) and(2). To the extent permitted in \u00a7 1005.32(a) and (b)(1), estimates may be used in the pre-payment disclosure described in \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1), the receipt disclosure described in \u00a7 1005.31(b)(2), the combined disclosure described in \u00a7 1005.31(b)(3), and the pre-payment disclosures and receipt disclosures for both first and subsequent preauthorized remittance transfers described in \u00a7 1005.36(a)(1) and (a)(2). Section 1005.32(b)(2) permits estimates to be used for certain information if the remittance transfer is scheduled by a sender five or more business days before the date of the transfer, for disclosures described in \u00a7 1005.36(a)(1)(i) and (a)(2)(i).\r\n\r\n{32-a-Interp}\r\n#### 32(a) Temporary Exception for Insured Institutions\r\n\r\n{32-a-1-Interp}\r\n#### 32(a)(1) General\r\n\r\n{32-a-1-Interp-1}\r\n1. *Control.* For purposes of this section, an insured institution cannot determine exact amounts \u201cfor reasons beyond its control\u201d when a person other than the insured institution or with which the insured institution has no correspondent relationship sets the exchange rate required to be disclosed under \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1)(iv) or imposes a covered third-party fee required to be disclosed under \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1)(vi). For example, if an insured institution has a correspondent relationship with an intermediary financial institution in another country and that intermediary institution sets the exchange rate or imposes a fee for remittance transfers sent from the insured institution to the intermediary institution, then the insured institution must determine exact amounts for the disclosures required under \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1)(iv) or (vi), because the determination of those amounts are not beyond the insured institution's control.\r\n\r\n{32-a-1-Interp-2}\r\n2. *Examples of scenarios that qualify for the temporary exception.* The following examples illustrate when an insured institution cannot determine an exact amount \u201cfor reasons beyond its control\u201d and thus would qualify for the temporary exception.\r\n\r\n{32-a-1-Interp-2-i}\r\ni. *Exchange rate.* An insured institution cannot determine the exact exchange rate to disclose under \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1)(iv) for an international wire transfer if the insured institution does not set the exchange rate, and the rate is set when the funds are deposited into the recipient's account by the designated recipient's institution with which the insured institution does not have a correspondent relationship. The insured institution will not know the exchange rate that the recipient institution will apply when the funds are deposited into the recipient's account.\r\n\r\n{32-a-1-Interp-2-ii}\r\nii. *Covered third-party fees.* An insured institution cannot determine the exact covered third-party fees to disclose under \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1)(vi) if an intermediary institution with which the insured institution does not have a correspondent relationship, imposes a transfer or conversion fee.\r\n\r\n{32-a-1-Interp-3}\r\n3. *Examples of scenarios that do not qualify for the temporary exception.* The following examples illustrate when an insured institution can determine exact amounts and thus would not qualify for the temporary exception.\r\n\r\n{32-a-1-Interp-3-i}\r\ni. *Exchange rate.* An insured institution can determine the exact exchange rate required to be disclosed under \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1)(iv) if it converts the funds into the local currency to be received by the designated recipient using an exchange rate that it sets. The determination of the exchange rate is in the insured institution's control even if there is no correspondent relationship with an intermediary institution in the transmittal route or the designated recipient's institution.\r\n\r\n{32-a-1-Interp-3-ii}\r\nii. *Covered third-party fees.* An insured institution can determine the exact covered third-party fees required to be disclosed under \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1)(vi) if it has agreed upon the specific fees with an intermediary correspondent institution, and this correspondent institution is the only institution in the transmittal route to the designated recipient's institution.\r\n\r\n{32-b-Interp}\r\n#### 32(b) Permanent Exceptions\r\n\r\n{32-b-1-Interp}\r\n#### 32(b)(1) Permanent Exceptions for Transfers to Certain Countries\r\n\r\n{32-b-1-Interp-1}\r\n1. *Laws of the recipient country.* The laws of the recipient country do not permit a remittance transfer provider to determine exact amounts required to be disclosed when a law or regulation of the recipient country requires the person making funds directly available to the designated recipient to apply an exchange rate that is:\r\n\r\n{32-b-1-Interp-1-i}\r\ni. Set by the government of the recipient country after the remittance transfer provider sends the remittance transfer or\r\n\r\n{32-b-1-Interp-1-ii}\r\nii. Set when the designated recipient receives the funds.\r\n\r\n{32-b-1-Interp-2}\r\n2. *Example illustrating when exact amounts can and cannot be determined because of the laws of the recipient country.*\r\n\r\n{32-b-1-Interp-2-i}\r\ni. The laws of the recipient country do not permit a remittance transfer provider to determine the exact exchange rate required to be disclosed under \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1)(iv) when, for example, the government of the recipient country, on a daily basis, sets the exchange rate that must, by law, apply to funds received and the funds are made available to the designated recipient in the local currency the day after the remittance transfer provider sends the remittance transfer.\r\n\r\n{32-b-1-Interp-2-ii}\r\nii. In contrast, the laws of the recipient country permit a remittance transfer provider to determine the exact exchange rate required to be disclosed under \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1)(iv) when, for example, the government of the recipient country ties the value of its currency to the U.S. dollar.\r\n\r\n{32-b-1-Interp-3}\r\n3. *Method by which transactions are made in the recipient country.* The method by which transactions are made in the recipient country does not permit a remittance transfer provider to determine exact amounts required to be disclosed when transactions are sent via international ACH on terms negotiated between the United States government and the recipient country's government, under which the exchange rate is a rate set by the recipient country's central bank or other governmental authority after the provider sends the remittance transfer.\r\n\r\n{32-b-1-Interp-4}\r\n4. *Example illustrating when exact amounts can and cannot be determined because of the method by which transactions are made in the recipient country.*\r\n\r\n{32-b-1-Interp-4-i}\r\ni. The method by which transactions are made in the recipient country does not permit a remittance transfer provider to determine the exact exchange rate required to be disclosed under \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1)(iv) when the provider sends a remittance transfer via international ACH on terms negotiated between the United States government and the recipient country's government, under which the exchange rate is a rate set by the recipient country's central bank on the business day after the provider has sent the remittance transfer.\r\n\r\n{32-b-1-Interp-4-ii}\r\nii. In contrast, a remittance transfer provider would not qualify for the \u00a7 1005.32(b)(1)(i)(B) methods exception if it sends a remittance transfer via international ACH on terms negotiated between the United States government and a private-sector entity or entities in the recipient country, under which the exchange rate is set by the institution acting as the entry point to the recipient country's payments system on the next business day. However, a remittance transfer provider sending a remittance transfer using such a method may qualify for the \u00a7 1005.32(a) temporary exception.\r\n\r\n{32-b-1-Interp-4-iii}\r\niii. A remittance transfer provider would not qualify for the \u00a7 1005.32(b)(1)(i)(B) methods exception if, for example, it sends a remittance transfer via international ACH on terms negotiated between the United States government and the recipient country's government, under which the exchange rate is set by the recipient country's central bank or other governmental authority before the sender requests a transfer.\r\n\r\n{32-b-1-Interp-5}\r\n5. *Safe harbor list.* If a country is included on a safe harbor list published by the Bureau under \u00a7 1005.32(b)(1)(ii), a remittance transfer provider may provide estimates of the amounts to be disclosed under \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1)(iv) through (b)(1)(vii). If a country does not appear on the Bureau's list, a remittance transfer provider may provide estimates under \u00a7 1005.32(b)(1)(i) if the provider determines that the recipient country does not legally permit or method by which transactions are conducted in that country does not permit the provider to determine exact disclosure amounts.\r\n\r\n{32-b-1-Interp-6}\r\n6. *Reliance on Bureau list of countries.* A remittance transfer provider may rely on the list of countries published by the Bureau to determine whether the laws of a recipient country do not permit the remittance transfer provider to determine exact amounts required to be disclosed under \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1)(iv) through (vii). Thus, if a country is on the Bureau's list, the provider may give estimates under this section, unless a remittance transfer provider has information that a country on the Bureau's list legally permits the provider to determine exact disclosure amounts.\r\n\r\n{32-b-1-Interp-7}\r\n7. *Change in laws of recipient country.*\r\n\r\n{32-b-1-Interp-7-i}\r\ni. If the laws of a recipient country change such that a remittance transfer provider can determine exact amounts, the remittance transfer provider must begin providing exact amounts for the required disclosures as soon as reasonably practicable if the provider has information that the country legally permits the provider to determine exact disclosure amounts.\r\n\r\n{32-b-1-Interp-7-ii}\r\nii. If the laws of a recipient country change such that a remittance transfer provider cannot determine exact disclosure amounts, the remittance transfer provider may provide estimates under \u00a7 1005.32(b)(1)(i), even if that country does not appear on the list published by the Bureau.\r\n\r\n{32-b-2-Interp}\r\n#### 32(b)(2) Permanent Exceptions for Transfers Scheduled Before the Date of Transfer\r\n\r\n{32-b-2-Interp-1}\r\n1. *Fixed amount of foreign currency.* The following is an example of when and how a remittance transfer provider may disclose estimates for remittance transfers scheduled five or more business days before the date of transfer where the provider agrees to the sender's request to fix the amount to be transferred in a currency in which the transfer will be received and not the currency in which it was funded. If on February 1, a sender schedules a 1000 Euro wire transfer to be sent from the sender's bank account denominated in U.S. dollars to a designated recipient on February 15, \u00a7 1005.32(b)(2) allows the provider to estimate the amount that will be transferred to the designated recipient ( *i.e.,* the amount described in \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1)(i)), any fees imposed or taxes collected on the remittance transfer by the provider (if based on the amount transferred) ( *i.e.,* the amount described in \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1)(ii)), and the total amount of the transaction ( *i.e.,* the amount described in \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1)(iii)). The provider may also estimate any covered third-party fees if the exchange rate is also estimated and the estimated exchange rate affects the amount of fees (as allowed by \u00a7 1005.32(b)(2)(ii)).\r\n\r\n{32-b-2-Interp-2}\r\n2. *Relationship to \u00a7 1005.10(d).* To the extent \u00a7 1005.10(d) requires, for an electronic fund transfer that is also a remittance transfer, notice when a preauthorized electronic fund transfer from the consumer's account will vary in amount from the previous transfer under the same authorization or from the preauthorized amount, that provision applies even if subpart B would not otherwise require notice before the date of transfer. However, insofar as \u00a7 1005.10(d) does not specify the form of such notice, a notice sent pursuant to \u00a7 1005.36(a)(2)(i) will satisfy \u00a7 1005.10(d) as long as the timing requirements of \u00a7 1005.10(d) are satisfied.\r\n\r\n{32-b-3-Interp}\r\n#### 32(b)(3) Permanent Exception for Optional Disclosure of Non-Covered Third-Party Fees and Taxes Collected on the Remittance Transfer by a Person Other Than the Provider\r\n\r\n{32-b-3-Interp-1}\r\n1. *Reasonable sources of information.* Pursuant to \u00a7 1005.32(b)(3) a remittance transfer provider may estimate applicable non-covered third-party fees and taxes collected on the remittance transfer by a person other than the provider using reasonable sources of information. Reasonable sources of information may include, for example: information obtained from recent transfers to the same institution or the same country or region; fee schedules from the recipient institution; fee schedules from the recipient institution's competitors; surveys of recipient institution fees in the same country or region as the recipient institution; information provided or surveys of recipient institutions' regulators or taxing authorities; commercially or publicly available databases, services or sources; and information or resources developed by international nongovernmental organizations or intergovernmental organizations.\r\n\r\n{32-c-Interp}\r\n#### 32(c) Bases for Estimates\r\n\r\n{32-c-1-Interp}\r\n#### 32(c)(1) Exchange Rate\r\n\r\n{32-c-1-Interp-1}\r\n*1. Most recent exchange rate for qualifying international ACH transfers.* If the exchange rate for a remittance transfer sent via international ACH that qualifies for the \u00a7 1005.32(b)(1)(i)(B) exception is set the following business day, the most recent exchange rate available for a transfer is the exchange rate set for the day that the disclosure is provided, *i.e.,* the current business day's exchange rate.\r\n\r\n{32-c-1-Interp-2}\r\n2. *Publicly available.* Examples of publicly available sources of information containing the most recent wholesale exchange rate for a currency include U.S. news services, such as Bloomberg, the Wall Street Journal, and the New York Times; a recipient country's national news services, and a recipient country's central bank or other government agency.\r\n\r\n{32-c-1-Interp-3}\r\n3. *Spread.* An estimate for disclosing the exchange rate based on the most recent publicly available wholesale exchange rate must also reflect any spread the remittance transfer provider typically applies to the wholesale exchange rate for remittance transfers for a particular currency.\r\n\r\n{32-c-1-Interp-4}\r\n4. *Most recent.* For the purposes of \u00a7 1005.32(c)(1)(ii) and (iii), if the exchange rate with respect to a particular currency is published or provided multiple times throughout the day because the exchange rate fluctuates throughout the day, a remittance transfer provider may use any exchange rate available on that day to determine the most recent exchange rate.\r\n\r\n{32-c-3-Interp}\r\n#### 32(c)(3) Covered Third-Party Fees\r\n\r\n{32-c-3-Interp-1}\r\n1. *Potential transmittal routes.* A remittance transfer from the sender's account at an insured institution to the designated recipient's institution may take several routes, depending on the correspondent relationships each institution in the transmittal route has with other institutions. In providing an estimate of the fees required to be disclosed under \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1)(vi) pursuant to the \u00a7 1005.32(a) temporary exception, an insured institution may rely upon the representations of the designated recipient's institution and the institutions that act as intermediaries in any one of the potential transmittal routes that it reasonably believes a requested remittance transfer may travel.\r\n\r\n{32-d-Interp}\r\n#### 32(d) Bases for Estimates for Transfers Scheduled Before the Date of Transfer\r\n\r\n{32-d-Interp-1}\r\n1. *In general.* When providing an estimate pursuant to \u00a7 1005.32(b)(2), \u00a7 1005.32(d) requires that a remittance transfer provider's estimated exchange rate must be the exchange rate (or estimated exchange rate) that the remittance transfer provider would have used or did use that day in providing disclosures to a sender requesting such a remittance transfer to be made on the same day. If, for the same-day remittance transfer, the provider could utilize either of the other two exceptions permitting the provision of estimates in \u00a7 1005.32(a) or (b)(1), the provider may provide estimates based on a methodology permitted under \u00a7 1005.32(c). For example, if, on February 1, the sender schedules a remittance transfer to occur on February 10, the provider should disclose the exchange rate as if the sender was requesting the transfer be sent on February 1. However, if at the time payment is made for the requested transfer, the remittance transfer provider could not send any remittance transfer until the next day (for reasons such as the provider's deadline for the batching of transfers), the remittance transfer provider can use the rate (or estimated exchange rate) that the remittance transfer provider would have used or did use in providing disclosures that day with respect to a remittance transfer requested that day that could not be sent until the following day.\r\n\r\n{33-Interp}\r\n### Section 1005.33 - Procedures for Resolving Errors\r\n\r\n{33-a-Interp}\r\n#### 33(a) Definition of Error\r\n\r\n{33-a-Interp-1}\r\n1. *Incorrect amount of currency paid by sender.* Section 1005.33(a)(1)(i) covers circumstances in which a sender pays an amount that differs from the total amount of the transaction, including fees imposed in connection with the transfer, stated in the receipt or combined disclosure provided under \u00a7 1005.31(b)(2) or (3). Such error may be asserted by a sender regardless of the form or method of payment provided, including when a debit, credit, or prepaid card is used to fund the transfer and an excess amount is paid. For example, if a remittance transfer provider incorrectly charged a sender's credit card account for US$150, and US$120 was sent, plus a transfer fee of US$10, the sender could assert an error with the remittance transfer provider for the incorrect charge under \u00a7 1005.33(a)(1)(i).\r\n\r\n{33-a-Interp-2}\r\n2. *Incorrect amount of currency received - coverage.* Section 1005.33(a)(1)(iii) covers circumstances in which the designated recipient receives an amount of currency that differs from the amount of currency identified on the disclosures provided to the sender, except where the disclosure stated an estimate of the amount of currency to be received in accordance with \u00a7 1005.32 and the difference results from application of the actual exchange rate, fees, and taxes, rather than any estimated amounts, or the failure was caused by circumstances outside the remittance transfer provider's control. A designated recipient may receive an amount of currency that differs from the amount of currency disclosed, for example, if an exchange rate other than the disclosed rate is applied to the remittance transfer, or if the provider fails to account for fees or taxes that may be imposed by the provider or a third party before the transfer is picked up by the designated recipient or deposited into the recipient's account in the foreign country. However, if the provider rounds the exchange rate used to calculate the amount received consistent with \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1)(iv) and comment 31(b)(1)(iv)-2 for the disclosed rate, there is no error if the designated recipient receives an amount of currency that results from applying the exchange rate used, prior to any rounding of the exchange rate, to calculate fees, taxes, or the amount received rather than the disclosed rate. Section 1005.33(a)(1)(iii) also covers circumstances in which the remittance transfer provider transmits an amount that differs from the amount requested by the sender.\r\n\r\n{33-a-Interp-3}\r\n3. *Incorrect amount of currency received - examples.* For purposes of the following examples illustrating the error for an incorrect amount of currency received under \u00a7 1005.33(a)(1)(iii), assume that none of the circumstances permitting an estimate under \u00a7 1005.32 apply (unless otherwise stated).\r\n\r\n{33-a-Interp-3-i}\r\ni. A consumer requests to send funds to a relative in Mexico to be received in local currency. Upon receiving the sender's payment, the remittance transfer provider provides a receipt indicating that the amount of currency that will be received by the designated recipient will be 1180 Mexican pesos, after fees and taxes are applied. However, when the relative picks up the transfer in Mexico a day later, he only receives 1150 Mexican pesos because the exchange rate applied by the recipient agent in Mexico was lower than the exchange rate used by the provider, prior to any rounding of the exchange rate, to disclose the amount of currency to be received by the designated recipient on the receipt. Because the designated recipient has received less than the amount of currency disclosed on the receipt, an error has occurred.\r\n\r\n{33-a-Interp-3-ii}\r\nii. A consumer requests to send funds to a relative in Colombia to be received in local currency. The remittance transfer provider provides the sender a receipt stating an amount of currency that will be received by the designated recipient, which does not reflect the additional foreign taxes that will be collected in Colombia on the transfer but does include the statement required by \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1)(viii). If the designated recipient will receive less than the amount of currency disclosed on the receipt due solely to the additional foreign taxes that the provider was not required to disclose, no error has occurred.\r\n\r\n{33-a-Interp-3-iii}\r\niii. Same facts as in ii., except that the receipt provided by the remittance transfer provider does not reflect additional fees that are imposed by the receiving agent in Colombia on the transfer. Because the designated recipient will receive less than the amount of currency disclosed in the receipt due to the additional covered third-party fees, an error has occurred.\r\n\r\n{33-a-Interp-3-iv}\r\niv. A consumer requests to send US$250 to a relative in India to a U.S. dollar-denominated account held by the relative at an Indian bank. Instead of the US$250 disclosed on the receipt as the amount to be sent, the remittance transfer provider sends US$200, resulting in a smaller deposit to the designated recipient's account than was disclosed as the amount to be received after fees and taxes. Because the designated recipient received less than the amount of currency that was disclosed, an error has occurred.\r\n\r\n{33-a-Interp-3-v}\r\nv. A consumer requests to send US$100 to a relative in a foreign country to be received in local currency. The remittance transfer provider provides the sender a receipt that discloses an estimated exchange rate, other taxes, and amount of currency that will be received due to the law in the foreign country requiring that the exchange rate be set by the foreign country's central bank. When the relative picks up the remittance transfer, the relative receives less currency than the estimated amount disclosed to the sender on the receipt due to application of the actual exchange rate, fees, and taxes, rather than any estimated amounts. Because \u00a7 1005.32(b) permits the remittance transfer provider to disclose an estimate of the amount of currency to be received, no error has occurred unless the estimate was not based on an approach set forth under \u00a7 1005.32(c).\r\n\r\n{33-a-Interp-3-vi}\r\nvi. A sender requests that his bank send US$120 to a designated recipient's account at an institution in a foreign country. The foreign institution is not an agent of the provider. Only US$100 is deposited into the designated recipient's account because the recipient institution imposed a US$20 incoming wire fee and deducted the fee from the amount transferred. Because this fee is a non-covered third-party fee that the provider is not required to disclose under \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1)(vi), no error has occurred if the provider provided the disclosure required by \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1)(viii).\r\n\r\n{33-a-Interp-4}\r\n4. *Incorrect amount of currency received - extraordinary circumstances.* Under \u00a7 1005.33(a)(1)(iii)(B), a remittance transfer provider's failure to make available to a designated recipient the amount of currency disclosed pursuant to \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1)(vii) and stated in the disclosure provided pursuant to \u00a7 1005.31(b)(2) or (3) for the remittance transfer is not an error if such failure was caused by extraordinary circumstances outside the remittance transfer provider's control that could not have been reasonably anticipated. Examples of extraordinary circumstances outside the remittance transfer provider's control that could not have been reasonably anticipated under \u00a7 1005.33(a)(1)(iii)(B) include circumstances such as war or civil unrest, natural disaster, garnishment or attachment of some of the funds after the transfer is sent, and government actions or restrictions that could not have been reasonably anticipated by the remittance transfer provider, such as the imposition of foreign currency controls or foreign taxes unknown at the time the receipt or combined disclosure is provided under \u00a7 1005.31(b)(2) or (3).\r\n\r\n{33-a-Interp-5}\r\n5. *Failure to make funds available by disclosed date of availability - coverage.* Section 1005.33(a)(1)(iv) generally covers disputes about the failure to make funds available in connection with a remittance transfer to a designated recipient by the disclosed date of availability. If only a portion of the funds were made available by the disclosed date of availability, then \u00a7 1005.33(a)(1)(iv) does not apply, but \u00a7 1005.33(a)(1)(iii) may apply instead. The following are examples of errors for failure to make funds available by the disclosed date of availability (assuming that none of the exceptions in \u00a7 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(A), (B), or (C) apply).\r\n\r\n{33-a-Interp-5-i}\r\ni. Late or non-delivery of a remittance transfer;\r\n\r\n{33-a-Interp-5-ii}\r\nii. Delivery of funds to the wrong account;\r\n\r\n{33-a-Interp-5-iii}\r\niii. The fraudulent pick-up of a remittance transfer in a foreign country by a person other than the designated recipient;\r\n\r\n{33-a-Interp-5-iv}\r\niv. The recipient agent or institution's retention of the remittance transfer, instead of making the funds available to the designated recipient.\r\n\r\n{33-a-Interp-6}\r\n6. *Failure to make funds available by disclosed date of availability - extraordinary circumstances.* Under \u00a7 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(A), a remittance transfer provider's failure to deliver or transmit a remittance transfer by the disclosed date of availability is not an error if such failure was caused by extraordinary circumstances outside the remittance transfer provider's control that could not have been reasonably anticipated. Examples of extraordinary circumstances outside the remittance transfer provider's control that could not have been reasonably anticipated under \u00a7 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(A) include circumstances such as war or civil unrest, natural disaster, garnishment or attachment of funds after the transfer is sent, and government actions or restrictions that could not have been reasonably anticipated by the remittance transfer provider, such as the imposition of foreign currency controls.\r\n\r\n{33-a-Interp-7}\r\n7. *Failure to make funds available by disclosed date of availability - fraud and other screening procedures.* Under \u00a7 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(B), a remittance transfer provider's failure to deliver funds by the disclosed date of availability is not an error if such delay is related to the provider's or any third party's investigation necessary to address potentially suspicious, blocked or prohibited activity, and the provider did not and could not have reasonably foreseen the delay so as to enable it to timely disclose an accurate date of availability when providing the sender with a receipt or combined disclosure. For example, no error occurs if delivery of funds is delayed because, after the receipt is provided, the provider's fraud screening system flags a remittance transfer because the designated recipient has a name similar to the name of a blocked person under a sanctions program and further investigation is needed to determine that the designated recipient is not actually a blocked person. Similarly, no error occurs where, after disclosing a date of availability to the sender, a remittance transfer provider receives specific law enforcement information indicating that the characteristics of a remittance transfer match a pattern of fraudulent activity, and as a result, the provider deems it necessary to delay delivery of the funds to allow for further investigation. However, if a delay could have been reasonably foreseen, the exception in \u00a7 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(B) would not apply. For example, if a provider knows in time to make a disclosure that all remittance transfers to a certain geographic area must undergo screening procedures that routinely delay such transfers by two days, the provider's failure to include the additional two days in its disclosure of the date of availability constitutes an error if delivery of the funds is indeed delayed beyond the disclosed date of availability.\r\n\r\n{33-a-Interp-8}\r\n8. *Sender account number or recipient institution identifier error.* The exception in \u00a7 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(D) applies where a sender gives the remittance transfer provider an incorrect account number or recipient institution identifier and all five conditions in \u00a7 1005.33(h) are satisfied. The exception does not apply, however, where the failure to make funds available is the result of a mistake by a provider or a third party or due to incorrect or insufficient information provided by the sender other than an incorrect account number or recipient institution identifier, such as an incorrect name of the recipient institution.\r\n\r\n{33-a-Interp-9}\r\n9. *Account number or recipient institution identifier.* For purposes of the exception in \u00a7 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(D), the terms account number and recipient institution identifier refer to alphanumerical account or institution identifiers other than names or addresses, such as account numbers, routing numbers, Canadian transit numbers, International Bank Account Numbers (IBANs), Business Identifier Codes (BICs) and other similar account or institution identifiers used to route a transaction. In addition and for purposes of this exception, the term designated recipient's account in \u00a7 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(D) refers to an asset account, regardless of whether it is a consumer asset account, established for any purpose and held by a bank, savings association, credit union, or equivalent institution. A designated recipient's account does not, however, include a credit card, prepaid card, or a virtual account held by an Internet-based or mobile telephone company that is not a bank, savings association, credit union or equivalent institution.\r\n\r\n{33-a-Interp-10}\r\n10. *Recipient-requested changes.* Under \u00a7 1005.33(a)(2)(iii), a change requested by the designated recipient that the remittance transfer provider or others involved in the remittance transfer decide to accommodate is not considered an error. The exception under \u00a7 1005.33(a)(2)(iii) is available only if the change is made solely because the designated recipient requested the change. For example, if a sender requests to send US$100 to a designated recipient at a designated location, but the designated recipient requests the amount in a different currency (either at the sender-designated location or another location requested by the recipient) and the remittance transfer provider accommodates the recipient's request, the change does not constitute an error.\r\n\r\n{33-a-Interp-11}\r\n11. *Change from disclosure made in reliance on sender information.* Under the commentary accompanying \u00a7 1005.31, the remittance transfer provider may rely on the sender's representations in making certain disclosures. *See, e.g.,* comments 31(b)(1)(iv)-1 and 31(b)(1)(vi)-1. For example, suppose a sender requests U.S. dollars to be deposited into an account of the designated recipient and represents that the account is U.S. dollar-denominated. If the designated recipient's account is actually denominated in local currency and the recipient account-holding institution must convert the remittance transfer into local currency in order to deposit the funds and complete the transfer, the change in currency does not constitute an error pursuant to \u00a7 1005.33(a)(2)(iv).\r\n\r\n{33-b-Interp}\r\n#### 33(b) Notice of Error From Sender\r\n\r\n{33-b-Interp-1}\r\n1. *Person asserting or discovering error.* The error resolution procedures of this section apply only when a notice of error is received from the sender, and not when a notice of error is received from the designated recipient or when the remittance transfer provider itself discovers and corrects an error.\r\n\r\n{33-b-Interp-2}\r\n2. *Content of error notice.* The notice of error is effective so long as the remittance transfer provider is able to identify the elements in \u00a7 1005.33(b)(1)(ii). For example, the sender could provide the confirmation number or code that would be used by the designated recipient to pick up the transfer, or other identification number or code supplied by the remittance transfer provider in connection with the transfer, if such number or code is sufficient for the remittance transfer provider to identify the sender (and contact information), designated recipient, and the transfer in question. For an account-based remittance transfer, the notice of error is effective even if it does not contain the sender's account number, so long as the remittance transfer provider is able to identify the account and the transfer in question.\r\n\r\n{33-b-Interp-3}\r\n3. *Address on notice of error.* A remittance transfer provider may request, or a sender may provide, the sender's or designated recipient's email address, as applicable, instead of a physical address, on a notice of error.\r\n\r\n{33-b-Interp-4}\r\n4. *Effect of late notice.* A remittance transfer provider is not required to comply with the requirements of this section for any notice of error from a sender that is received by the provider more than 180 days from the disclosed date of availability of the remittance transfer to which the notice of error applies or, if applicable, more than 60 days after a provider sent documentation, additional information, or clarification requested by the sender, provided such date is later than 180 days after the disclosed date of availability.\r\n\r\n{33-b-Interp-5}\r\n5. *Notice of error provided to agent.* A notice of error provided by a sender to an agent of the remittance transfer provider is deemed to be received by the provider under \u00a7 1005.33(b)(1)(i) when received by the agent.\r\n\r\n{33-b-Interp-6}\r\n6. *Consumer notice of error resolution rights.* Section 1005.31 requires a remittance transfer provider to include an abbreviated notice of the consumer's error resolution rights on the receipt or combined notice provided under \u00a7 1005.31(b)(2) or (3). In addition, the remittance transfer provider must make available to a sender upon request, a notice providing a full description of the sender's error resolution rights, using language set forth in Appendix A of this part (Model Form A-36) or substantially similar language.\r\n\r\n{33-c-Interp}\r\n#### 33(c) Time Limits and Extent of Investigation\r\n\r\n{33-c-Interp-1}\r\n1. *Notice to sender of finding of error.* If the remittance transfer provider determines during its investigation that an error occurred as described by the sender, the remittance provider may inform the sender of its findings either orally or in writing. However, if the provider determines that no error or a different error occurred, the provider must provide a written explanation of its findings under \u00a7 1005.33(d)(1).\r\n\r\n{33-c-Interp-2}\r\n2. *Incorrect or insufficient information provided for transfer.* The remedy in \u00a7 1005.33(c)(2)(iii) applies if a remittance transfer provider's failure to make funds in connection with a remittance transfer available to a designated recipient by the disclosed date of availability occurred because the sender provided incorrect or insufficient information in connection with the transfer, such as by erroneously identifying the designated recipient's address or by providing insufficient information such that the entity distributing the funds cannot identify the correct designated recipient. A sender is not considered to have provided incorrect or insufficient information for purposes of \u00a7 1005.33(c)(2)(iii) if the provider discloses the incorrect location where the transfer may be picked up, gives the wrong confirmation number/code for the transfer, or otherwise miscommunicates information necessary for the designated recipient to pick-up the transfer. The remedies in \u00a7 1005.33(c)(2)(iii) do not apply if the sender provided an incorrect account number or recipient institution identifier and the provider has met the requirements of \u00a7 1005.33(h) because under \u00a7 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(D) no error would have occurred. *See* \u00a7 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(D) and comment 33(a)-7.\r\n\r\n{33-c-Interp-3}\r\n3. *Designation of requested remedy.* Under \u00a7 1005.33(c)(2)(ii), the sender may generally choose to obtain a refund of funds that were not properly transmitted or delivered to the designated recipient or, request redelivery of the amount appropriate to correct the error at no additional cost unless the error is determined to have occurred because the sender provided incorrect or insufficient information. Upon receiving the sender's request, the remittance transfer provider shall correct the error within one business day, or as soon as reasonably practicable, applying the same exchange rate, fees, and taxes stated in the disclosure provided under \u00a7 1005.31(b)(2) or (3), if the sender requests delivery of the amount appropriate to correct the error and the error did not occur because the sender provided incorrect or insufficient information. The provider may also request that the sender indicate the preferred remedy at the time the sender provides notice of the error although if provider does so, it should indicate that the if the sender chooses a resend at the time, the remedy may be unavailable if the error occurred because the sender provided incorrect or insufficient information. However, if the sender does not indicate the desired remedy at the time of providing notice of error, the remittance transfer provider must notify the sender of any available remedies in the report provided under \u00a7 1005.33(c)(1) or (d)(1) if the provider determines an error occurred.\r\n\r\n{33-c-Interp-4}\r\n4. *Default remedy.* Unless the sender provided incorrect or insufficient information and \u00a7 1005.33(c)(2)(iii) applies, the remittance transfer provider may set a default remedy that the provider will provide if the sender does not designate a remedy within a reasonable time after the sender receives the report provided under \u00a7 1005.33(c)(1). A provider that permits a sender to designate a remedy within 10 days after the provider has sent the report provided under \u00a7 1005.33(c)(1) or (d)(1) before imposing the default remedy is deemed to have provided the sender with a reasonable time to designate a remedy. In the case a default remedy is provided, the provider must correct the error within one business day, or as soon as reasonably practicable, after the reasonable time for the sender to designate the remedy has passed, consistent with \u00a7 1005.33(c)(2).\r\n\r\n{33-c-Interp-5}\r\n5. *Amount appropriate to resolve the error.* For purposes of the remedies set forth in \u00a7 1005.33(c)(2)(i)(A), (c)(2)(i)(B), (c)(2)(ii)(A)( *1*), and (c)(2)(i)(A)( *2*) the amount appropriate to resolve the error is the specific amount of transferred funds that should have been received if the remittance transfer had been effected without error. The amount appropriate to resolve the error does not include consequential damages. For example, when the amount that was disclosed pursuant to \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1)(vii) was received by the designated recipient before the provider must determine the appropriate remedy for an error under \u00a7 1005.33(a)(1)(iv), no additional amounts are required to resolve the error after the remittance transfer provider refunds the appropriate fees and taxes paid by the sender pursuant to \u00a7 1005.33(c)(2)(ii)(B) or (c)(2)(iii), as applicable.\r\n\r\n{33-c-Interp-6}\r\n6. *Form of refund.* For a refund provided under \u00a7 1005.33(c)(2)(i)(A), (c)(2)(ii)(A)( *1*), (c)(2)(ii)(B), or (c)(2)(iii), a remittance transfer provider may generally, at its discretion, issue a refund either in cash or in the same form of payment that was initially provided by the sender for the remittance transfer. For example, if the sender originally provided a credit card as payment for the transfer, the remittance transfer provider may issue a credit to the sender's credit card account in the appropriate amount. However, if a sender initially provided cash for the remittance transfer, a provider may issue a refund by check. For example, if the sender originally provided cash as payment for the transfer, the provider may mail a check to the sender in the amount of the payment.\r\n\r\n{33-c-Interp-7}\r\n7. *Remedies for incorrect amount paid.* If an error under \u00a7 1005.33(a)(1)(i) occurred, the sender may request the remittance transfer provider refund the amount necessary to resolve the error under \u00a7 1005.33(c)(2)(i)(A) or that the remittance transfer provider make the amount necessary to resolve the error available to the designated recipient at no additional cost under \u00a7 1005.33(c)(2)(i)(B).\r\n\r\n{33-c-Interp-8}\r\n8. *Correction of an error if funds not available by disclosed date.* If the remittance transfer provider determines an error of failure to make funds available by the disclosed date occurred under \u00a7 1005.33(a)(1)(iv), it must correct the error in accordance with \u00a7 1005.33(c)(2)(ii)(A), as applicable, and refund any fees imposed for the transfer (unless the sender provided incorrect or insufficient information to the remittance transfer provider in connection with the remittance transfer), whether the fee was imposed by the provider or a third party involved in sending the transfer, such as an intermediary bank involved in sending a wire transfer or the institution from which the funds are picked up in accordance with \u00a7 1005.33(c)(2)(ii)(B).\r\n\r\n{33-c-Interp-9}\r\n9. *Charges for error resolution.* If an error occurred, whether as alleged or in a different amount or manner, the remittance transfer provider may not impose a charge related to any aspect of the error resolution process (including charges for documentation or investigation).\r\n\r\n{33-c-Interp-10}\r\n10. *Correction without investigation.* A remittance transfer provider may correct an error, without investigation, in the amount or manner alleged by the sender, or otherwise determined, to be in error, but must comply with all other applicable requirements of \u00a7 1005.33.\r\n\r\n{33-c-Interp-11}\r\n11. *Procedure for sending a new remittance transfer after a sender provides incorrect or insufficient information.* Section 1005.33(c)(2)(iii) generally requires a remittance transfer provider to refund the transfer amount to the sender even if the sender's previously designated remedy was a resend or if the provider's default remedy in other circumstances is a resend. However, if before the refund is processed, the sender receives notice pursuant to \u00a7 1005.33(c)(1) or (d)(1) that an error occurred because the sender provided incorrect or insufficient information and then requests that the provider send the remittance transfer again, and the provider agrees to that request, \u00a7 1005.33(c)(2)(iii) requires that the request be treated as a new remittance transfer and the provider must provide new disclosures in accordance with \u00a7 1005.31 and all other applicable provisions of subpart B. However, \u00a7 1005.33(c)(2)(iii) does not obligate the provider to agree to a sender's request to send a new remittance transfer.\r\n\r\n{33-c-Interp-12}\r\n12. *Determining amount of refund.* Section 1005.33(c)(2)(iii) permits the provider to deduct from the amount refunded, or applied towards a new transfer, any fees or taxes actually deducted from the transfer amount by a person other than the provider as part of the first unsuccessful remittance transfer attempt or that were deducted in the course of returning the transfer amount to the provider following a failed delivery. However, a provider may not deduct those fees and taxes that will ultimately be refunded to the provider. When the provider deducts fees or taxes from the amount refunded pursuant to \u00a7 1005.33(c)(2)(iii), the provider must inform the sender of the deduction as part of the notice required by either \u00a7 1005.33(c)(1) or (d)(1) and the reason for the deduction. The following examples illustrate these concepts.\r\n\r\n{33-c-Interp-12-i}\r\ni. A sender instructs a remittance transfer provider to send US$100 to a designated recipient in local currency, for which the provider charges a transfer fee of US$10 (and thus the sender pays the provider $110). The provider's correspondent imposes a fee of US$15 that it deducts from the amount of the transfer. The sender provides incorrect or insufficient information that results in non-delivery of the remittance transfer as requested. Once the provider determines that an error occurred because the sender provided incorrect or insufficient information, the provider must provide the report required by \u00a7 1005.33(c)(1) or (d)(1) and inform the sender, pursuant to \u00a7 1005.33(c)(1) or (d)(1), that it will refund US$95 to the sender within three business days, unless the sender chooses to apply the US$95 towards a new remittance transfer and the provider agrees. Of the $95 that is refunded to the sender, $10 reflects the refund of the provider's transfer fee, and $85 reflects the refund of the amount of funds provided by the sender in connection with the transfer which was not properly transmitted. The provider is not required to refund the US$15 fee imposed by the correspondent (unless the $15 will be refunded to the provider by the correspondent).\r\n\r\n{33-c-Interp-12-ii}\r\nii. A sender instructs a remittance transfer provider to send US$100 to a designated recipient in a foreign country, for which the provider charges a transfer fee of US$10 (and thus the sender pays the provider US$110) and an intermediary institution charges a lifting fee of US$5, such that the designated recipient is expected to receive only US$95, as indicated in the receipt. If an error occurs because the sender provides incorrect or insufficient information that results in non-delivery of the remittance transfer by the date of availability stated in the disclosure provided to the sender for the remittance transfer under \u00a7 1005.31(b)(2) or (3), the provider is required to refund, or reapply if requested and the provider agrees, $105 unless the intermediary institution refunds to the provider the US$5 fee. If the sender requests to have the transfer amount applied to a new remittance transfer pursuant to \u00a7 1005.33(c)(2)(iii) and provides the corrected or additional information, and the remittance transfer provider agrees to a resend remedy, the remittance transfer provider may charge the sender another transfer fee of US$10 to send the remittance transfer again with the corrected or additional information necessary to complete the transfer. Insofar as the resend is an entirely new remittance transfer, the provider must provide a prepayment disclosure and receipt or combined disclosure in accordance with, among other provisions, the timing requirements of \u00a7 1005.31(f) and the cancellation provision of \u00a7 1005.34(a).\r\n\r\n{33-c-Interp-12-iii}\r\niii. In connection with a remittance transfer, a provider imposes a $15 tax that it then remits to a State taxing authority. An error occurs because the sender provided incorrect or insufficient information that resulted in non-delivery of the transfer to the designated recipient. The provider may deduct $15 from the amount it refunds to the sender pursuant to \u00a7 1005.33(c)(2)(iii) unless the relevant tax law will result in the $15 tax being refunded to the provider by the State taxing authority because the transfer was not completed.\r\n\r\n{33-d-Interp}\r\n#### 33(d) Procedures if Remittance Transfer Provider Determines No Error or Different Error Occurred\r\n\r\n{33-d-Interp-1}\r\n1. *Error different from that alleged.* When a remittance transfer provider determines that an error occurred in a manner or amount different from that described by the sender, it must comply with the requirements of both \u00a7 1005.33(c) and (d), as applicable. The provider may give the notice of correction and the explanation separately or in a combined form.\r\n\r\n{33-e-Interp}\r\n#### 33(e) Reassertion of Error\r\n\r\n{33-e-Interp-1}\r\n1. *Withdrawal of error; right to reassert.* The remittance transfer provider has no further error resolution responsibilities if the sender voluntarily withdraws the notice alleging an error. A sender who has withdrawn an allegation of error has the right to reassert the allegation unless the remittance transfer provider had already complied with all of the error resolution requirements before the allegation was withdrawn. The sender must do so, however, within the original 180-day period from the disclosed date of availability or, if applicable, the 60-day period for a notice of error asserted pursuant to \u00a7 1005.33(b)(2).\r\n\r\n{33-f-Interp}\r\n#### 33(f) Relation to Other Laws\r\n\r\n{33-f-Interp-1}\r\n1. *Concurrent error obligations.* A financial institution that is also the remittance transfer provider may have error obligations under both \u00a7\u00a7 1005.11 and 1005.33. For example, if a sender asserts an error under \u00a7 1005.11 with a remittance transfer provider that holds the sender's account, and the error is not also an error under \u00a7 1005.33 (such as the omission of an EFT on a periodic statement), then the error-resolution provisions of \u00a7 1005.11 exclusively apply to the error. However, if a sender asserts an error under \u00a7 1005.33 with a remittance transfer provider that holds the sender's account, and the error is also an error under \u00a7 1005.11 (such as when the amount the sender requested to be deducted from the sender's account and sent for the remittance transfer differs from the amount that was actually deducted from the account and sent), then the error-resolution provisions of \u00a7 1005.33 exclusively apply to the error.\r\n\r\n{33-f-Interp-2}\r\n2. *Holder in due course.* Nothing in this section limits a sender's rights to assert claims and defenses against a card issuer concerning property or services purchased with a credit card under Regulation Z, 12 CFR 1026.12(c)(1), as applicable.\r\n\r\n{33-f-Interp-3}\r\n3. *Assertion of same error with multiple parties.* If a sender receives credit to correct an error of an incorrect amount paid in connection with a remittance transfer from either the remittance transfer provider or account-holding institution (or creditor), and subsequently asserts the same error with another party, that party has no further responsibilities to investigate the error if the error has been corrected. For example, assume that a sender initially asserts an error with a remittance transfer provider with respect to a remittance transfer alleging that US$130 was debited from his checking account, but the sender only requested a remittance transfer for US$100, plus a US$10 transfer fee. If the remittance transfer provider refunds US$20 to the sender to correct the error, and the sender subsequently asserts the same error with his account-holding institution, the account-holding institution has no error resolution responsibilities under Regulation E because the error has been fully corrected. In addition, nothing in this section prevents an account-holding institution or creditor from reversing amounts it has previously credited to correct an error if a sender receives more than one credit to correct the same error. For example, assume that a sender concurrently asserts an error with his or her account-holding institution and remittance transfer provider for the same error, and the sender receives credit from the account-holding institution for the error within 45 days of the notice of error. If the remittance transfer provider subsequently provides a credit of the same amount to the sender for the same error, the account-holding institution may reverse the amounts it had previously credited to the consumer's account, even after the 45-day error resolution period under \u00a7 1005.11.\r\n\r\n{33-g-Interp}\r\n#### 33(g) Error Resolution Standards and Recordkeeping Requirements\r\n\r\n{33-g-Interp-1}\r\n1. *Record retention requirements.* As noted in \u00a7 1005.33(g)(2), remittance transfer providers are subject to the record retention requirements under \u00a7 1005.13. Therefore, remittance transfer providers must retain documentation, including documentation related to error investigations, for a period of not less than two years from the date a notice of error was submitted to the provider or action was required to be taken by the provider. A remittance transfer provider need not maintain records of individual disclosures that it has provided to each sender; it need only retain evidence demonstrating that its procedures reasonably ensure the sender's receipt of required disclosures and documentation.\r\n\r\n{33-h-Interp}\r\n#### 33(h) Incorrect Account Number Supplied\r\n\r\n{33-h-Interp-1}\r\n1. *Reasonable methods of verification.* When a sender provides an incorrect recipient institution identifier, \u00a7 1005.33(h)(2) limits the exception in \u00a7 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(D) to situations where the provider used reasonably available means to verify that the recipient institution identifier provided by the sender did correspond to the recipient institution name provided by the sender. Reasonably available means may include accessing a directory of Business Identifier Codes and verifying that the code provided by the sender matches the provided institution name, and, if possible, the specific branch or location provided by the sender. Providers may also rely on other commercially available databases or directories to check other recipient institution identifiers. If reasonable verification means fail to identify that the recipient institution identifier is incorrect, the exception in \u00a7 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(D) will apply, assuming that the provider can satisfy the other conditions in \u00a7 1005.33(h). Similarly, if no reasonably available means exist to verify the accuracy of the recipient institution identifier, \u00a7 1005.33(h)(2) would be satisfied and thus the exception in \u00a7 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(D) also will apply, again assuming the provider can satisfy the other conditions in \u00a7 1005.33(h). However, where a provider does not employ reasonably available means to verify a recipient institution identifier, \u00a7 1005.33(h)(2) is not satisfied and the exception in \u00a7 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(D) will not apply.\r\n\r\n{33-h-Interp-2}\r\n2. *Reasonable efforts.* Section 1005.33(h)(5) requires a remittance transfer provider to use reasonable efforts to recover the amount that was to be received by the designated recipient. Whether a provider has used reasonable efforts does not depend on whether the provider is ultimately successful in recovering the amount that was to be received by the designated recipient. Under \u00a7 1005.33(h)(5), if the remittance transfer provider is requested to provide documentation or other supporting information in order for the pertinent institution or authority to obtain the proper authorization for the return of the incorrectly credited amount, reasonable efforts to recover the amount include timely providing any such documentation to the extent that it is available and permissible under law. The following are examples of reasonable efforts:\r\n\r\n{33-h-Interp-2-i}\r\ni. The remittance transfer provider promptly calls or otherwise contacts the institution that received the transfer, either directly or indirectly through any correspondent(s) or other intermediaries or service providers used for the particular transfer, to request that the amount that was to be received by the designated recipient be returned, and if required by law or contract, by requesting that the recipient institution obtain a debit authorization from the holder of the incorrectly credited account.\r\n\r\n{33-h-Interp-2-ii}\r\nii. The remittance transfer provider promptly uses a messaging service through a funds transfer system to contact institution that received the transfer, either directly or indirectly through any correspondent(s) or other intermediaries or service providers used for the particular transfer, to request that the amount that was to be received by the designated recipient be returned, in accordance with the messaging service's rules and protocol, and if required by law or contract, by requesting that the recipient institution obtain a debit authorization from the holder of the incorrectly credited account.\r\n\r\n{33-h-Interp-3}\r\n3. *Promptness of Reasonable Efforts.* Section 1005.33(h)(5) requires that a remittance transfer provider act promptly in using reasonable efforts to recover the amount that was to be received by the designated recipient. Whether a provider acts promptly to use reasonable efforts depends on the facts and circumstances. For example, if, before the date of availability disclosed pursuant to \u00a7 1005.31(b)(2)(ii), the sender informs the provider that the sender provided a mistaken account number, the provider will have acted promptly if it attempts to contact the recipient's institution before the date of availability.\r\n\r\n{34-Interp}\r\n### Section 1005.34 - Procedures for Cancellation and Refund of Remittance Transfers\r\n\r\n{34-a-Interp}\r\n#### 34(a) Sender Right of Cancellation and Refund\r\n\r\n{34-a-Interp-1}\r\n1. *Content of cancellation request.* A request to cancel a remittance transfer is valid so long as the remittance transfer provider is able to identify the remittance transfer in question. For example, the sender could provide the confirmation number or code that would be used by the designated recipient to pick up the transfer or other identification number or code supplied by the remittance transfer provider in connection with the transfer, if such number or code is sufficient for the remittance transfer provider to identify the transfer. A remittance transfer provider may also request, or the sender may provide, the sender's email address instead of a physical address, so long as the remittance transfer provider is able to identify the transfer to which the request to cancel applies.\r\n\r\n{34-a-Interp-2}\r\n2. *Notice of cancellation right.* Section 1005.31 requires a remittance transfer provider to include an abbreviated notice of the sender's right to cancel a remittance transfer on the receipt or combined disclosure given under \u00a7 1005.31(b)(2) or (3). In addition, the remittance transfer provider must make available to a sender upon request, a notice providing a full description of the right to cancel a remittance transfer using language that is set forth in Model Form A-36 of Appendix A to this part or substantially similar language.\r\n\r\n{34-a-Interp-3}\r\n3. *Thirty-minute cancellation right.* A remittance transfer provider must comply with the cancellation and refund requirements of \u00a7 1005.34 if the cancellation request is received by the provider no later than 30 minutes after the sender makes payment. The provider may, at its option, provide a longer time period for cancellation. A provider must provide the 30-minute cancellation right regardless of the provider's normal business hours. For example, if an agent closes less than 30 minutes after the sender makes payment, the provider could opt to take cancellation requests through the telephone number disclosed on the receipt. The provider could also set a cutoff time after which the provider will not accept requests to send a remittance transfer. For example, a financial institution that closes at 5:00 p.m. could stop accepting payment for remittance transfers after 4:30 p.m.\r\n\r\n{34-a-Interp-4}\r\n4. *Cancellation request provided to agent.* A cancellation request provided by a sender to an agent of the remittance transfer provider is deemed to be received by the provider under \u00a7 1005.34(a) when received by the agent.\r\n\r\n{34-a-Interp-5}\r\n5. *Payment made.* For purposes of subpart B, payment is made, for example, when a sender provides cash to the remittance transfer provider or when payment is authorized.\r\n\r\n{34-b-Interp}\r\n#### 34(b) Time Limits and Refund Requirements\r\n\r\n{34-b-Interp-1}\r\n1. *Form of refund.* At its discretion, a remittance transfer provider generally may issue a refund either in cash or in the same form of payment that was initially provided by the sender for the remittance transfer. For example, if the sender originally provided a credit card as payment for the transfer, the remittance transfer provider may issue a credit to the sender's credit card account in the amount of the payment. However, if a sender initially provided cash for the remittance transfer, a provider may issue a refund by check. For example, if the sender originally provided cash as payment for the transfer, the provider may mail a check to the sender in the amount of the payment.\r\n\r\n{34-b-Interp-2}\r\n2. *Fees and taxes refunded.* If a sender provides a timely request to cancel a remittance transfer, a remittance transfer provider must refund all funds provided by the sender in connection with the remittance transfer, including any fees and, to the extent not prohibited by law, taxes that have been imposed for the transfer, whether the fee or tax was assessed by the provider or a third party, such as an intermediary institution, the agent or bank in the recipient country, or a State or other governmental body.\r\n\r\n{35-Interp}\r\n### Section 1005.35 - Acts of Agents\r\n\r\n{35-Interp-1}\r\n1. *General.* Remittance transfer providers must comply with the requirements of subpart B, including, but not limited to, providing the disclosures set forth in \u00a7 1005.31 and providing any remedies as set forth in \u00a7 1005.33, even if an agent or other person performs functions for the remittance transfer provider, and regardless of whether the provider has an agreement with a third party that transfers or otherwise makes funds available to a designated recipient.\r\n\r\n{36-Interp}\r\n### Section 1005.36 - Transfers Scheduled Before the Date of Transfer\r\n\r\n{36-Interp-1}\r\n1. *Applicability of subpart B.* The requirements set forth in subpart B apply to remittance transfers subject to \u00a7 1005.36, to the extent that \u00a7 1005.36 does not modify those requirements. For example, the foreign language disclosure requirements in \u00a7 1005.31(g) and related commentary continue to apply to disclosures provided in accordance with \u00a7 1005.36(a)(2).\r\n\r\n{36-a-Interp}\r\n#### 36(a) Timing\r\n\r\n{36-a-2-Interp}\r\n#### 36(a)(2) Subsequent Preauthorized Remittance Transfers\r\n\r\n{36-a-2-Interp-1}\r\n1. *Changes in Disclosures.* When a sender schedules a series of preauthorized remittance transfers, the provider is generally not required to provide a pre-payment disclosure prior to the date of each subsequent transfer. However, \u00a7 1005.36(a)(1)(i) requires the provider to provide a pre-payment disclosure and receipt for the first in the series of preauthorized remittance transfers in accordance with the timing requirements set forth in \u00a7 1005.31(e). While certain information in those disclosures is expressly permitted to be estimated (see \u00a7 1005.32(b)(2)), other information is not permitted to be estimated, or is limited in how it may be estimated. When any of the information on the most recent receipt provided pursuant to \u00a7 1005.36(a)(1)(i) or (a)(2)(i), other than the temporal disclosures required by \u00a7 1005.31(b)(2)(ii) and (b)(2)(vii), is no longer accurate with respect to a subsequent preauthorized remittance transfer for reasons other than as permitted by \u00a7 1005.32, the provider must provide, within a reasonable time prior to the scheduled date of the next preauthorized remittance transfer, a receipt that complies with \u00a7 1005.31(b)(2) and which discloses, among the other disclosures required by \u00a7 1005.31(b)(2), the changed terms. For example, if the provider discloses in the pre-payment disclosure for the first in the series of preauthorized remittance transfers that its fee for each remittance transfer is $20 and, after six preauthorized remittance transfers, the provider increases its fee to $30 (to the extent permitted by contract law), the provider must provide the sender a receipt that complies with \u00a7\u00a7 1005.31(b)(2) and 1005.36(b)(2) within a reasonable time prior to the seventh transfer. Barring a further change, this receipt will apply to transfers after the seventh transfer. Or, if, after the sixth transfer, a tax collected by the provider increases from 1.5% of the amount that will be transferred to the designated recipient to 2.0% of the amount that will be transferred to the designated recipient, the provider must provide the sender a receipt that complies with \u00a7\u00a7 1005.31(b)(2) and 1005.36(b)(2) within a reasonable time prior to the seventh transfer. In contrast, \u00a7 1005.36(a)(2)(i) does not require an updated receipt where an exchange rate, estimated as permitted by \u00a7 1005.32(b)(2), changes.\r\n\r\n{36-a-2-Interp-2}\r\n2. *Clearly and conspicuously.* In order to indicate clearly and conspicuously that the provider's fee has changed as required by \u00a7 1005.36(a)(2)(i), the provider could, for example, state on the receipt: \u201cTransfer Fees (UPDATED) * * * $30.\u201d To the extent that other figures on the receipt must be revised because of the new fee, the receipt should also indicate that those figures are updated.\r\n\r\n{36-a-2-Interp-3}\r\n3. *Reasonable time.* If a disclosure required by \u00a7 1005.36(a)(2)(i) or (d)(1) is mailed, the disclosure would be considered to be received by the sender five business days after it is posted in the mail. If hand delivered or provided electronically, the receipt would be considered to be received by the sender at the time of delivery. Thus, if the provider mails a disclosure required by \u00a7 1005.36(a)(2)(i) or (d)(1) not later than ten business days before the scheduled date of the transfer, or hand or electronically delivers a disclosure not later than five business days before the scheduled date of the transfer, the provider would be deemed to have provided the disclosure within a reasonable time prior to the scheduled date of the subsequent preauthorized remittance transfer.\r\n\r\n{36-b-Interp}\r\n#### 36(b) Accuracy\r\n\r\n{36-b-Interp-1}\r\n1. *Use of estimates.* In providing the disclosures described in \u00a7 1005.36(a)(1)(i) or (a)(2)(i), remittance transfer providers may use estimates to the extent permitted by any of the exceptions in \u00a7 1005.32. When estimates are permitted, however, they must be disclosed in accordance with \u00a7 1005.31(d).\r\n\r\n{36-b-Interp-2}\r\n2. *Subsequent preauthorized remittance transfers.* For a subsequent transfer in a series of preauthorized remittance transfers, the receipt provided pursuant to \u00a7 1005.36(a)(1)(i), except for the temporal disclosures in that receipt required by \u00a7 1005.31(b)(2)(ii) (Date Available) and (b)(2)(vii) (Transfer Date), applies to each subsequent preauthorized remittance transfer unless and until it is superseded by a receipt provided pursuant to \u00a7 1005.36(a)(2)(i). For each subsequent preauthorized remittance transfer, only the most recent receipt provided pursuant to \u00a7 1005.36(a)(1)(i) or (a)(2)(i) must be accurate as of the date each subsequent transfer is made.\r\n\r\n{36-b-Interp-3}\r\n3. *Receipts.* A receipt required by \u00a7 1005.36(a)(1)(ii) or (a)(2)(ii) must accurately reflect the details of the transfer to which it pertains and may not contain estimates pursuant to \u00a7 1005.32(b)(2). However, the remittance transfer provider may continue to disclose estimates to the extent permitted by \u00a7 1005.32(a) or (b)(1). In providing receipts pursuant to \u00a7 1005.36(a)(1)(ii) or (a)(2)(ii), \u00a7 1005.36(b)(2) and (3) do not allow a remittance transfer provider to change figures previously disclosed on a receipt provided pursuant to \u00a7 1005.36(a)(1)(i) or (a)(2)(i), unless a figure was an estimate or based on an estimate disclosed pursuant to \u00a7 1005.32. Thus, for example, if a provider disclosed its fee as $10 in a receipt provided pursuant to \u00a7 1005.36(a)(1)(i) and that receipt contained an estimate of the exchange rate pursuant to \u00a7 1005.32(b)(2), the second receipt provided pursuant to \u00a7 1005.36(a)(1)(ii) must also disclose the fee as $10.\r\n\r\n{36-c-Interp}\r\n#### 36(c) Cancellation\r\n\r\n{36-c-Interp-1}\r\n1. *Scheduled remittance transfer.* Section 1005.36(c) applies when a remittance transfer is scheduled by the sender at least three business days before the date of the transfer, whether the sender schedules a preauthorized remittance transfer or a one-time transfer. A remittance transfer is scheduled if it will require no further action by the sender to send the transfer after the sender requests the transfer. For example, a remittance transfer is scheduled at least three business days before the date of the transfer, and \u00a7 1005.36(c) applies, where a sender on March 1 requests a remittance transfer provider to send a wire transfer to pay a bill in a foreign country on March 15, if it will require no further action by the sender to send the transfer after the sender requests the transfer. A remittance transfer is not scheduled, and \u00a7 1005.36(c) does not apply, where a transfer occurs more than three days after the date the sender requests the transfer solely due to the provider's processing time. The following are examples of when a sender has not scheduled a remittance transfer at least three business days before the date of the remittance transfer, such that the cancellation rule in \u00a7 1005.34 applies.\r\n\r\n{36-c-Interp-1-i}\r\ni. A sender on March 1 requests a remittance transfer provider to send a wire transfer to pay a bill in a foreign country on March 3.\r\n\r\n{36-c-Interp-1-ii}\r\nii. A sender on March 1 requests that a remittance transfer provider send a remittance transfer on March 15, but the provider requires the sender to confirm the request on March 14 in order to send the transfer.\r\n\r\n{36-c-Interp-1-iii}\r\niii. A sender on March 1 requests that a remittance transfer provider send an ACH transfer, and that transfer is sent on March 2, but due to the time required for processing, funds will not be deducted from the sender's account until March 5.\r\n\r\n{36-c-Interp-2}\r\n2. *Cancelled preauthorized remittance transfers.* For preauthorized remittance transfers, the provider must assume the request to cancel applies to all future preauthorized remittance transfers, unless the sender specifically indicates that it should apply only to the next scheduled remittance transfer.\r\n\r\n{36-c-Interp-3}\r\n3. *Concurrent cancellation obligations.* A financial institution that is also a remittance transfer provider may have both stop payment obligations under \u00a7 1005.10 and cancellation obligations under \u00a7 1005.36. If a sender cancels a remittance transfer under \u00a7 1005.36 with a remittance transfer provider that holds the sender's account, and the transfer is a preauthorized transfer under \u00a7 1005.10, then the cancellation provisions of \u00a7 1005.36 exclusively apply.\r\n\r\n{36-d-Interp}\r\n#### 36(d) Date of Transfer for Subsequent Preauthorized Remittance Transfers\r\n\r\n{36-d-Interp-1}\r\n1. *General.* Section 1005.36(d)(2)(i) permits remittance transfer providers some flexibility in determining how and when the disclosures required by \u00a7 1005.36(d)(1) may be provided to senders. The disclosure described in \u00a7 1005.36(d)(1) may be provided as a separate disclosure, or on or with any other disclosure required by this subpart B related to the same series of preauthorized remittance transfers, provided that the disclosure and timing requirements in \u00a7 1005.36(d)(2) and other applicable provisions in subpart B are satisfied. For example, the required disclosures may be made on or with a receipt provided pursuant to \u00a7 1005.36(a)(1)(i); a receipt provided pursuant to \u00a7 1005.36(a)(2); or in a separate disclosure created by the provider. Thus, for example, a remittance transfer provider complies with \u00a7 1005.36(d)(1) for a period of one year if it provides in the receipt provided to the sender when payment is made for the initial preauthorized remittance transfer, a schedule or summary of the dates of transfer of all the subsequent preauthorized remittance transfers in the series scheduled to occur over the next 12 months (and the applicable cancellation requirements and contact information).\r\n\r\n{36-d-Interp-2}\r\n2. *Delivery of disclosure.* Section 1005.36(d)(2)(i) requires that the sender receive disclosure of the date of transfer, applicable cancellation requirements, and the provider's contact information no more than 12 months, and no less than 5 business days prior to the date of transfer of the subsequent preauthorized remittance transfer. For purposes of determining when a disclosure required by \u00a7 1005.36(d)(1) is received by the sender, refer to comment 36(a)(2)-3.\r\n\r\n{36-d-Interp-3}\r\n3. *Disclosure of the date of transfer.* The date of transfer of a subsequent preauthorized remittance transfer may be disclosed as a specific date ( *e.g.,* July 19, 2013) or by using a method that clearly permits identification of the date of the transfer, such as periodic intervals ( *e.g.,* the third Monday of every month, or the 15th of every month). If the future dates of transfer are disclosed as occurring periodically and there is a break in the sequence, or the date of transfer does not otherwise conform to the described period, *e.g.,* if a holiday or weekend causes the provider to deviate from the normal schedule, the remittance transfer provider should disclose the specific date of transfer for the affected transfer.\r\n\r\n{36-d-Interp-4}\r\n4. *Accuracy requirements.* Section 1005.36(d)(4) sets forth accuracy requirements for disclosures required for subsequent preauthorized remittance transfers under \u00a7 1005.36(d)(1). If any of the information provided in these disclosures change, the provider must provide an updated disclosure with the revised information that is accurate as of when the transfer is made, pursuant to \u00a7 1005.36(d)(2).\r\n",

        "contents": "## Appendix A - Model Disclosure Clauses and Forms\r\n\r\n{A-Interp-1}\r\n1. *Review of forms.* The Bureau will not review or approve disclosure forms or statements for financial institutions. However, the Bureau has issued model clauses for institutions to use in designing their disclosures. If an institution uses these clauses accurately to reflect its service, the institution is protected from liability for failure to make disclosures in proper form.\r\n\r\n{A-Interp-2}\r\n2. *Use of forms.* The appendix contains model disclosure clauses for optional use by financial institutions and remittance transfer providers to facilitate compliance with the disclosure requirements of \u00a7\u00a7 1005.5(b)(2) and (3), 1005.6(a), 1005.7, 1005.8(b), 1005.14(b)(1)(ii), 1005.15(d)(1) and (2), 1005.18(c)(1) and (2), 1005.31, 1005.32 and 1005.36. The use of appropriate clauses in making disclosures will protect a financial institution and a remittance transfer provider from liability under sections 916 and 917 of the act provided the clauses accurately reflect the institution's EFT services and the provider's remittance transfer services, respectively.\r\n\r\n{A-Interp-3}\r\n3. *Altering the clauses.* Financial institutions may use clauses of their own design in conjunction with the Bureau's model clauses. The inapplicable words or portions of phrases in parentheses should be deleted. The catchlines are not part of the clauses and need not be used. Financial institutions may make alterations, substitutions, or additions in the clauses to reflect the services offered, such as technical changes (including the substitution of a trade name for the word \u201ccard,\u201d deletion of inapplicable services, or substitution of lesser liability limits). Several of the model clauses include references to a telephone number and address. Where two or more of these clauses are used in a disclosure, the telephone number and address may be referenced and need not be repeated.\r\n\r\n{A-Interp-4}\r\n4. *Model forms for remittance transfers.* The Bureau will not review or approve disclosure forms for remittance transfer providers. However, this appendix contains 15 model forms for use in connection with remittance transfers. These model forms are intended to demonstrate several formats a remittance transfer provider may use to comply with the requirements of \u00a7 1005.31(b). Model Forms A-30 through A-32 demonstrate how a provider could provide the required disclosures for a remittance transfer exchanged into local currency. Model Forms A-30(a), (b), (c), and (d) demonstrate four options regarding model language related to the required disclaimer, where applicable, of non-covered third-party fees and taxes on the remittance transfer collected by a person other than the provider under \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1)(viii). Model forms 30(b) through (d) also include language that may be used if a provider elects to estimate either these non-covered third-party fees or taxes collected by a person other than the provider as part of the disclaimer. Model Forms A-33 through A-35 demonstrate how a provider could provide the required disclosures for dollar-to-dollar remittance transfers. These forms also demonstrate disclosure of the required content, in accordance with the grouping and proximity requirements of \u00a7 1005.31(c)(1) and (2), in both a register receipt format and an 8.5 inch by 11 inch format. Model Form A-36 provides long form model error resolution and cancellation disclosures required by \u00a7 1005.31(b)(4), and Model Form A-37 provides short form model error resolution and cancellation disclosures required by \u00a7 1005.31(b)(2)(iv) and (vi). Model Forms A-38 through A-41 provide language for Spanish language disclosures.\r\n\r\n{A-Interp-4-i}\r\ni. The model forms contain information that is not required by subpart B, including a confirmation code, the sender's name and contact information, and the optional disclosure of the estimated amount of these non-covered third-party fees and taxes collected by a person other than the provider as part of the disclaimer. Additional information not required by subpart B may be presented on the model forms as permitted by \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1)(viii) and (c)(4). Any additional information must be presented consistent with a remittance transfer provider's obligation to provide required disclosures in a clear and conspicuous manner.\r\n\r\n{A-Interp-4-ii}\r\nii. Use of the model forms is optional. A remittance transfer provider may change the forms by rearranging the format or by making modifications to the language of the forms, in each case without modifying the substance of the disclosures. Any rearrangement or modification of the format of the model forms must be consistent with the form, grouping, proximity, and other requirements of \u00a7 1005.31(a) and (c). Providers making revisions that do not comply with this section will lose the benefit of the safe harbor for appropriate use of Model Forms A-30 to A-41.\r\n\r\n{A-Interp-4-iii}\r\niii. Permissible changes to the language and format of the model forms include, for example:\r\n\r\n{A-Interp-4-iii-A}\r\nA. Substituting the information contained in the model forms that is intended to demonstrate how to complete the information in the model forms - such as names, addresses, and Web sites; dates; numbers; and State-specific contact information - with information applicable to the remittance transfer. In addition, if the applicable non-covered third-party fees are imposed by an institution other than a bank, a provider could modify the disclaimer accordingly.\r\n\r\n{A-Interp-4-iii-B}\r\nB. Eliminating disclosures that are not applicable to the transfer, as described under \u00a7 1005.31(b). For example, if only covered third-party fees are imposed, a provider would not use a disclaimer related to additional fees that may apply because all applicable fees are covered and included in the disclosure as required under \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1)(vi).\r\n\r\n{A-Interp-4-iii-C}\r\nC. Correcting or updating telephone numbers, mailing addresses, or Web site addresses that may change over time.\r\n\r\n{A-Interp-4-iii-D}\r\nD. Providing the disclosures on a paper size that is different from a register receipt and 8.5 inch by 11 inch formats.\r\n\r\n{A-Interp-4-iii-E}\r\nE. Adding a term substantially similar to \u201cestimated\u201d in close proximity to the specified terms in \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1) and (2), as required under \u00a7 1005.31(d).\r\n\r\n{A-Interp-4-iii-F}\r\nF. Providing the disclosures in a foreign language, or multiple foreign languages, subject to the requirements of \u00a7 1005.31(g).\r\n\r\n{A-Interp-4-iii-G}\r\nG. Substituting cancellation language to reflect the right to a cancellation made pursuant to the requirements of \u00a7 1005.36(c).\r\n\r\n{A-Interp-4-iv}\r\niv. Changes to the model forms that are not permissible include, for example, adding information that is not segregated from the required disclosures, other than as permitted by \u00a7 1005.31(c)(4).\r\n",

        "contents": "{2-Interp}\r\n### Section 1005.2 Definitions\r\n\r\n{2-a-Interp}\r\n#### 2(a) Access Device\r\n\r\n{2-a-Interp-1}\r\n1. *Examples.* The term \u201caccess device\u201d includes debit cards, personal identification numbers (PINs), telephone transfer and telephone bill payment codes, and other means that may be used by a consumer to initiate an electronic fund transfer (EFT) to or from a consumer account. The term does not include magnetic tape or other devices used internally by a financial institution to initiate electronic transfers.\r\n\r\n{2-a-Interp-2}\r\n2. *Checks used to capture information.* The term \u201caccess device\u201d does not include a check or draft used to capture the Magnetic Ink Character Recognition (MICR) encoding to initiate a one-time automated clearinghouse (ACH) debit. For example, if a consumer authorizes a one-time ACH debit from the consumer's account using a blank, partially completed, or fully completed and signed check for the merchant to capture the routing, account, and serial numbers to initiate the debit, the check is not an access device. (Although the check is not an access device under Regulation E, the transaction is nonetheless covered by the regulation. *See* comment 3(b)(1)-1.v.)\r\n\r\n{2-b-Interp}\r\n#### 2(b) Account\r\n\r\n{2-b-Interp-1}\r\n1. *Consumer asset account.* The term \u201cconsumer asset account\u201d includes:\r\n\r\n{2-b-Interp-1-i}\r\ni. Club accounts, such as vacation clubs. In many cases, however, these accounts are exempt from the regulation under \u00a7 1005.3(c)(5) because all electronic transfers to or from the account have been preauthorized by the consumer and involve another account of the consumer at the same institution.\r\n\r\n{2-b-Interp-1-ii}\r\nii. A retail repurchase agreement (repo), which is a loan made to a financial institution by a consumer that is collateralized by government or government-insured securities.\r\n\r\n{2-b-Interp-2}\r\n2. *Certain employment-related cards not covered.* The term \u201cpayroll card account\u201d does not include a card used solely to disburse incentive-based payments (other than commissions which can represent the primary means through which a consumer is paid), such as bonuses, which are unlikely to be a consumer's primary source of salary or other compensation. The term also does not include a card used solely to make disbursements unrelated to compensation, such as petty cash reimbursements or travel per diem payments. Similarly, a payroll card account does not include a card that is used in isolated instances to which an employer typically does not make recurring payments, such as when providing final payments or in emergency situations when other payment methods are unavailable. However, all transactions involving the transfer of funds to or from a payroll card account are covered by the regulation, even if a particular transaction involves payment of a bonus, other incentive-based payment, or reimbursement, or the transaction does not represent a transfer of wages, salary, or other employee compensation.\r\n\r\n{2-b-Interp-3}\r\n3. Examples of accounts not covered by Regulation E (12 CFR part 1005) include:\r\n\r\n{2-b-Interp-3-i}\r\ni. Profit-sharing and pension accounts established under a trust agreement, which are exempt under \u00a7 1005.2(b)(2).\r\n\r\n{2-b-Interp-3-ii}\r\nii. Escrow accounts, such as those established to ensure payment of items such as real estate taxes, insurance premiums, or completion of repairs or improvements.\r\n\r\n{2-b-Interp-3-iii}\r\niii. Accounts for accumulating funds to purchase U.S. savings bonds.\r\n\r\n{2-b-2-Interp}\r\n#### Paragraph 2(b)(2)\r\n\r\n{2-b-2-Interp-1}\r\n1. *Bona fide trust agreements.* The term \u201cbona fide trust agreement\u201d is not defined by the Act or regulation; therefore, financial institutions must look to state or other applicable law for interpretation.\r\n\r\n{2-b-2-Interp-2}\r\n2. *Custodial agreements.* An account held under a custodial agreement that qualifies as a trust under the Internal Revenue Code, such as an individual retirement account, is considered to be held under a trust agreement for purposes of Regulation E.\r\n\r\n{2-d-Interp}\r\n#### 2(d) Business Day\r\n\r\n{2-d-Interp-1}\r\n1. *Duration.* A business day includes the entire 24-hour period ending at midnight, and a notice required by the regulation is effective even if given outside normal business hours. The regulation does not require, however, that a financial institution make telephone lines available on a 24-hour basis.\r\n\r\n{2-d-Interp-2}\r\n2. *Substantially all business functions.* Substantially all business functions include both the public and the back-office operations of the institution. For example, if the offices of an institution are open on Saturdays for handling some consumer transactions (such as deposits, withdrawals, and other teller transactions), but not for performing internal functions (such as investigating account errors), then Saturday is not a business day for that institution. In this case, Saturday does not count toward the business-day standard set by the regulation for reporting lost or stolen access devices, resolving errors, *etc.*\r\n\r\n{2-d-Interp-3}\r\n3. *Short hours.* A financial institution may determine, at its election, whether an abbreviated day is a business day. For example, if an institution engages in substantially all business functions until noon on Saturdays instead of its usual 3 p.m. closing, it may consider Saturday a business day.\r\n\r\n{2-d-Interp-4}\r\n4. *Telephone line.* If a financial institution makes a telephone line available on Sundays for reporting the loss or theft of an access device, but performs no other business functions, Sunday is not a business day under the substantially all business functions standard.\r\n\r\n{2-h-Interp}\r\n#### 2(h) Electronic Terminal\r\n\r\n{2-h-Interp-1}\r\n1. *Point-of-sale (POS) payments initiated by telephone.* Because the term \u201celectronic terminal\u201d excludes a telephone operated by a consumer, a financial institution need not provide a terminal receipt when:\r\n\r\n{2-h-Interp-1-i}\r\ni. A consumer uses a debit card at a public telephone to pay for the call.\r\n\r\n{2-h-Interp-1-ii}\r\nii. A consumer initiates a transfer by a means analogous in function to a telephone, such as by home banking equipment or a facsimile machine.\r\n\r\n{2-h-Interp-2}\r\n2. *POS terminals.* A POS terminal that captures data electronically, for debiting or crediting to a consumer's asset account, is an electronic terminal for purposes of Regulation E even if no access device is used to initiate the transaction. *See* \u00a7 1005.9 for receipt requirements.\r\n\r\n{2-h-Interp-3}\r\n3. *Teller-operated terminals.* A terminal or other computer equipment operated by an employee of a financial institution is not an electronic terminal for purposes of the regulation. However, transfers initiated at such terminals by means of a consumer's access device (using the consumer's PIN, for example) are EFTs and are subject to other requirements of the regulation. If an access device is used only for identification purposes or for determining the account balance, the transfers are not EFTs for purposes of the regulation.\r\n\r\n{2-k-Interp}\r\n#### 2(k) Preauthorized Electronic Fund Transfer\r\n\r\n{2-k-Interp-1}\r\n1. *Advance authorization.* A preauthorized electronic fund transfer under Regulation E is one authorized by the consumer in advance of a transfer that will take place on a recurring basis, at substantially regular intervals, and will require no further action by the consumer to initiate the transfer. In a bill-payment system, for example, if the consumer authorizes a financial institution to make monthly payments to a payee by means of EFTs, and the payments take place without further action by the consumer, the payments are preauthorized EFTs. In contrast, if the consumer must take action each month to initiate a payment (such as by entering instructions on a touch-tone telephone or home computer), the payments are not preauthorized EFTs.\r\n\r\n{2-m-Interp}\r\n#### 2(m) Unauthorized Electronic Fund Transfer\r\n\r\n{2-m-Interp-1}\r\n1. *Transfer by institution's employee.* A consumer has no liability for erroneous or fraudulent transfers initiated by an employee of a financial institution.\r\n\r\n{2-m-Interp-2}\r\n2. *Authority.* If a consumer furnishes an access device and grants authority to make transfers to a person (such as a family member or co-worker) who exceeds the authority given, the consumer is fully liable for the transfers unless the consumer has notified the financial institution that transfers by that person are no longer authorized.\r\n\r\n{2-m-Interp-3}\r\n3. *Access device obtained through robbery or fraud.* An unauthorized EFT includes a transfer initiated by a person who obtained the access device from the consumer through fraud or robbery.\r\n\r\n{2-m-Interp-4}\r\n4. *Forced initiation.* An EFT at an ATM is an unauthorized transfer if the consumer has been induced by force to initiate the transfer.\r\n\r\n{2-m-Interp-5}\r\n5. *Reversal of direct deposits.* The reversal of a direct deposit made in error is not an unauthorized EFT when it involves:\r\n\r\n{2-m-Interp-5-i}\r\ni. A credit made to the wrong consumer's account;\r\n\r\n{2-m-Interp-5-ii}\r\nii. A duplicate credit made to a consumer's account; or\r\n\r\n{2-m-Interp-5-iii}\r\niii. A credit in the wrong amount (for example, when the amount credited to the consumer's account differs from the amount in the transmittal instructions).\r\n\r\n",

The consumer and the financial institution (including an account for which an access device has been issued to the consumer, for example);\r\n\r\n{3-a-Interp-1-ii}\r\nii. The consumer and a third party (for preauthorized debits or credits, for example), when the account-holding institution has received notice of the agreement and the fund transfers have begun.\r\n\r\n{3-a-Interp-2}\r\n2. *Automated clearing house (ACH) membership.* The fact that membership in an ACH requires a financial institution to accept EFTs to accounts at the institution does not make every account of that institution subject to the regulation.\r\n\r\n{3-a-Interp-3}\r\n3. *Foreign applicability.* Regulation E applies to all persons (including branches and other offices of foreign banks located in the United States) that offer EFT services to residents of any state, including resident aliens. It covers any account located in the United States through which EFTs are offered to a resident of a state. This is the case whether or not a particular transfer takes place in the United States and whether or not the financial institution is chartered in the United States or a foreign country. The regulation does not apply to a foreign branch of a U.S. bank unless the EFT services are offered in connection with an account in a state as defined in \u00a7 1005.2(l).\r\n\r\n{3-b-Interp}\r\n#### 3(b) Electronic Fund Transfer\r\n\r\n{3-b-1-Interp}\r\n#### 3(b)(1) Definition\r\n\r\n{3-b-1-Interp-1}\r\n1. *Fund transfers covered.* The term \u201celectronic fund transfer\u201d includes:\r\n\r\n{3-b-1-Interp-1-i}\r\ni. A deposit made at an ATM or other electronic terminal (including a deposit in cash or by check) provided a specific agreement exists between the financial institution and the consumer for EFTs to or from the account to which the deposit is made.\r\n\r\n{3-b-1-Interp-1-ii}\r\nii. A transfer sent via ACH. For example, social security benefits under the U.S. Treasury's direct-deposit program are covered, even if the listing of payees and payment amounts reaches the account-holding institution by means of a computer printout from a correspondent bank.\r\n\r\n{3-b-1-Interp-1-iii}\r\niii. A preauthorized transfer credited or debited to an account in accordance with instructions contained on magnetic tape, even if the financial institution holding the account sends or receives a composite check.\r\n\r\n{3-b-1-Interp-1-iv}\r\niv. A transfer from the consumer's account resulting from a debit-card transaction at a merchant location, even if no electronic terminal is involved at the time of the transaction, if the consumer's asset account is subsequently debited for the amount of the transfer.\r\n\r\n{3-b-1-Interp-1-v}\r\nv. A transfer via ACH where a consumer has provided a check to enable the merchant or other payee to capture the routing, account, and serial numbers to initiate the transfer, whether the check is blank, partially completed, or fully completed and signed; whether the check is presented at POS or is mailed to a merchant or other payee or lockbox and later converted to an EFT; or whether the check is retained by the consumer, the merchant or other payee, or the payee's financial institution.\r\n\r\n{3-b-1-Interp-1-vi}\r\nvi. A payment made by a bill payer under a bill-payment service available to a consumer via computer or other electronic means, unless the terms of the bill-payment service explicitly state that all payments, or all payments to a particular payee or payees, will be solely by check, draft, or similar paper instrument drawn on the consumer's account, and the payee or payees that will be paid in this manner are identified to the consumer.\r\n\r\n{3-b-1-Interp-2}\r\n2. *Fund transfers not covered.* The term \u201celectronic fund transfer\u201d does not include:\r\n\r\n{3-b-1-Interp-2-i}\r\ni. A payment that does not debit or credit a consumer asset account, such as a payroll allotment to a creditor to repay a credit extension (which is deducted from salary).\r\n\r\n{3-b-1-Interp-2-ii}\r\nii. A payment made in currency by a consumer to another person at an electronic terminal.\r\n\r\n{3-b-1-Interp-2-iii}\r\niii. A preauthorized check drawn by the financial institution on the consumer's account (such as an interest or other recurring payment to the consumer or another party), even if the check is computer-generated.\r\n\r\n{3-b-1-Interp-2-iv}\r\niv. Transactions arising from the electronic collection, presentment, or return of checks through the check collection system, such as through transmission of electronic check images.\r\n\r\n{3-b-2-Interp}\r\n#### 3(b)(2) Electronic Fund Transfer Using Information From a Check\r\n\r\n{3-b-2-Interp-1}\r\n1. *Notice at POS not furnished due to inadvertent error.* If the copy of the notice under section 1005.3(b)(2)(ii) for electronic check conversion (ECK) transactions is not provided to the consumer at POS because of a bona fide unintentional error, such as when a terminal printing mechanism jams, no violation results if the payee maintains procedures reasonably adapted to avoid such occurrences.\r\n\r\n{3-b-2-Interp-2}\r\n2. *Authorization to process a transaction as an EFT or as a check.* In order to process a transaction as an EFT, or alternatively as a check, the payee must obtain the consumer's authorization to do so. A payee may, at its option, specify the circumstances under which a check may not be converted to an EFT. *See* model clauses in appendix A-6.\r\n\r\n{3-b-2-Interp-3}\r\n3. *Notice for each transfer.* Generally, a notice to authorize an electronic check conversion transaction must be provided for each transaction. For example, a consumer must receive a notice that the transaction will be processed as an EFT for each transaction at POS or each time a consumer mails a check in an accounts receivable (ARC) transaction to pay a bill, such as a utility bill, if the payee intends to convert a check received as payment. Similarly, the consumer must receive notice if the payee intends to collect a service fee for insufficient or uncollected funds via an EFT for each transaction whether at POS or if the consumer mails a check to pay a bill. The notice about when funds may be debited from a consumer's account and the non-return of consumer checks by the consumer's financial institution must also be provided for each transaction. However, if in an ARC transaction, a payee provides a coupon book to a consumer, for example, for mortgage loan payments, and the payment dates and amounts are set out in the coupon book, the payee may provide a single notice on the coupon book stating all of the required disclosures under paragraph (b)(2) of this section in order to obtain authorization for each conversion of a check and any debits via EFT to the consumer's account to collect any service fees imposed by the payee for insufficient or uncollected funds in the consumer's account. The notice must be placed on a conspicuous location of the coupon book that a consumer can retain - for example, on the first page, or inside the front cover.\r\n\r\n{3-b-2-Interp-4}\r\n4. *Multiple payments/multiple consumers.* If a merchant or other payee will use information from a consumer's check to initiate an EFT from the consumer's account, notice to a consumer listed on the billing account that a check provided as payment during a single billing cycle or after receiving an invoice or statement will be processed as a one-time EFT or as a check transaction constitutes notice for all checks provided in payment for the billing cycle or the invoice for which notice has been provided, whether the check(s) is submitted by the consumer or someone else. The notice applies to all checks provided in payment for the billing cycle or invoice until the provision of notice on or with the next invoice or statement. Thus, if a merchant or other payee receives a check as payment for the consumer listed on the billing account after providing notice that the check will be processed as a one-time EFT, the authorization from that consumer constitutes authorization to convert any other checks provided for that invoice or statement. Other notices required under this paragraph (b)(2) (for example, to collect a service fee for insufficient or uncollected funds via an EFT) provided to the consumer listed on the billing account also constitutes notice to any other consumer who may provide a check for the billing cycle or invoice.\r\n\r\n{3-b-2-Interp-5}\r\n5. *Additional disclosures about ECK transactions at POS.* When a payee initiates an EFT at POS using information from the consumer's check, and returns the check to the consumer at POS, the payee need not provide a notice to the consumer that the check will not be returned by the consumer's financial institution.\r\n\r\n{3-b-3-Interp}\r\n#### 3(b)(3) Collection of Returned Item Fees via Electronic Fund Transfer\r\n\r\n{3-b-3-Interp-1}\r\n1. *Fees imposed by account-holding institution.* The requirement to obtain a consumer's authorization to collect a fee via EFT for the return of an EFT or check unpaid applies only to the person that intends to initiate an EFT to collect the returned item fee from the consumer's account. The authorization requirement does not apply to any fees assessed by the consumer's account-holding financial institution when it returns the unpaid underlying EFT or check or pays the amount of an overdraft.\r\n\r\n{3-b-3-Interp-2}\r\n2. *Accounts receivable transactions.* In an ARC transaction where a consumer sends in a payment for amounts owed (or makes an in-person payment at a biller's physical location, such as when a consumer makes a loan payment at a bank branch or places a payment in a drop box), a person seeking to electronically collect a fee for items returned unpaid must obtain the consumer's authorization to collect the fee in this manner. A consumer authorizes a person to electronically collect a returned item fee when the consumer receives notice, typically on an invoice or statement, that the person may collect the fee through an EFT to the consumer's account, and the consumer goes forward with the underlying transaction by providing payment. The notice must also state the dollar amount of the fee. However, an explanation of how that fee will be determined may be provided in place of the dollar amount of the fee if the fee may vary due to the amount of the transaction or due to other factors, such as the number of days the underlying transaction is left outstanding. For example, if a state law permits a maximum fee of $30 or 10% of the underlying transaction, whichever is greater, the person collecting the fee may explain how the fee is determined, rather than state a specific dollar amount for the fee.\r\n\r\n{3-b-3-Interp-3}\r\n3. *Disclosure of dollar amount of fee for POS transactions.* The notice provided to the consumer in connection with a POS transaction under \u00a7 1005.3(b)(3)(ii) must state the amount of the fee for a returned item if the dollar amount of the fee can be calculated at the time the notice is provided or mailed. For example, if notice is provided to the consumer at the time of the transaction, if the applicable state law sets a maximum fee that may be collected for a returned item based on the amount of the underlying transaction (such as where the amount of the fee is expressed as a percentage of the underlying transaction), the person collecting the fee must state the actual dollar amount of the fee on the notice provided to the consumer. Alternatively, if the amount of the fee to be collected cannot be calculated at the time of the transaction (for example, where the amount of the fee will depend on the number of days a debt continues to be owed), the person collecting the fee may provide a description of how the fee will be determined on both the posted notice as well as on the notice provided at the time of the transaction. However, if the person collecting the fee elects to send the consumer notice after the person has initiated an EFT to collect the fee, that notice must state the amount of the fee to be collected.\r\n\r\n{3-b-3-Interp-4}\r\n4. *Third party providing notice.* The person initiating an EFT to a consumer's account to electronically collect a fee for an item returned unpaid may obtain the authorization and provide the notices required under \u00a7 1005.3(b)(3) through third parties, such as merchants.\r\n\r\n{3-c-Interp}\r\n#### 3(c) Exclusions From Coverage\r\n\r\n{3-c-1-Interp}\r\n#### 3(c)(1) Checks\r\n\r\n{3-c-1-Interp-1}\r\n1. *Re-presented checks.* The electronic re-presentment of a returned check is not covered by Regulation E because the transaction originated by check. Regulation E does apply, however, to any fee debited via an EFT from a consumer's account by the payee because the check was returned for insufficient or uncollected funds. The person debiting the fee electronically must obtain the consumer's authorization.\r\n\r\n{3-c-1-Interp-2}\r\n2. *Check used to capture information for a one-time EFT. See* comment 3(b)(1)-1.v.\r\n\r\n{3-c-2-Interp}\r\n#### 3(c)(2) Check Guarantee or Authorization\r\n\r\n{3-c-2-Interp-1}\r\n1. *Memo posting.* Under a check guarantee or check authorization service, debiting of the consumer's account occurs when the check or draft is presented for payment. These services are exempt from coverage, even when a temporary hold on the account is memo-posted electronically at the time of authorization.\r\n\r\n{3-c-3-Interp}\r\n#### 3(c)(3) Wire or Other Similar Transfers\r\n\r\n{3-c-3-Interp-1}\r\n1. *Fedwire and ACH.* If a financial institution makes a fund transfer to a consumer's account after receiving funds through Fedwire or a similar network, the transfer by ACH is covered by the regulation even though the Fedwire or network transfer is exempt.\r\n\r\n{3-c-3-Interp-2}\r\n2. *Article 4A.* Financial institutions that offer telephone-initiated Fedwire payments are subject to the requirements of UCC section 4A-202, which encourages verification of Fedwire payment orders pursuant to a security procedure established by agreement between the consumer and the receiving bank. These transfers are not subject to Regulation E and the agreement is not considered a telephone plan if the service is offered separately from a telephone bill-payment or other prearranged plan subject to Regulation E. Regulation J of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (12 CFR part 210) specifies the rules applicable to funds handled by Federal Reserve Banks. To ensure that the rules for all fund transfers through Fedwire are consistent, the Board of Governors used its preemptive authority under UCC section 4A-107 to determine that subpart B of the Board's Regulation J, including the provisions of Article 4A, applies to all fund transfers through Fedwire, even if a portion of the fund transfer is governed by the EFTA. The portion of the fund transfer that is governed by the EFTA is not governed by subpart B of the Board's Regulation J.\r\n\r\n{3-c-3-Interp-3}\r\n3. *Similar fund transfer systems.* Fund transfer systems that are similar to Fedwire include the Clearing House Interbank Payments System (CHIPS), Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT), Telex, and transfers made on the books of correspondent banks.\r\n\r\n{3-c-4-Interp}\r\n#### 3(c)(4) Securities and Commodities Transfers\r\n\r\n{3-c-4-Interp-1}\r\n1. *Coverage.* The securities exemption applies to securities and commodities that may be sold by a registered broker-dealer or futures commission merchant, even when the security or commodity itself is not regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission or the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.\r\n\r\n{3-c-4-Interp-2}\r\n2. *Example of exempt transfer.* The exemption applies to a transfer involving a transfer initiated by a telephone order to a stockbroker to buy or sell securities or to exercise a margin call.\r\n\r\n{3-c-4-Interp-3}\r\n3. *Examples of nonexempt transfers.* The exemption does not apply to a transfer involving:\r\n\r\n{3-c-4-Interp-3-i}\r\ni. A debit card or other access device that accesses a securities or commodities account such as a money market mutual fund and that the consumer uses for purchasing goods or services or for obtaining cash.\r\n\r\n{3-c-4-Interp-3-ii}\r\nii. A payment of interest or dividends into the consumer's account (for example, from a brokerage firm or from a Federal Reserve Bank for government securities).\r\n\r\n{3-c-5-Interp}\r\n#### 3(c)(5) Automatic Transfers by Account-Holding Institution\r\n\r\n{3-c-5-Interp-1}\r\n1. *Automatic transfers exempted.* The exemption applies to:\r\n\r\n{3-c-5-Interp-1-i}\r\ni. Electronic debits or credits to consumer accounts for check charges, stop-payment charges, non-sufficient funds (NSF) charges, overdraft charges, provisional credits, error adjustments, and similar items that are initiated automatically on the occurrence of certain events.\r\n\r\n{3-c-5-Interp-1-ii}\r\nii. Debits to consumer accounts for group insurance available only through the financial institution and payable only by means of an aggregate payment from the institution to the insurer.\r\n\r\n{3-c-5-Interp-1-iii}\r\niii. EFTs between a thrift institution and its paired commercial bank in the state of Rhode Island, which are deemed under state law to be intra-institutional.\r\n\r\n{3-c-5-Interp-1-iv}\r\niv. Automatic transfers between a consumer's accounts within the same financial institution, even if the account holders on the two accounts are not identical.\r\n\r\n{3-c-5-Interp-2}\r\n2. *Automatic transfers not exempted.* Transfers between accounts of the consumer at affiliated institutions (such as between a bank and its subsidiary or within a holding company) are not intra-institutional transfers, and thus do not qualify for the exemption.\r\n\r\n{3-c-6-Interp}\r\n#### 3(c)(6) Telephone-Initiated Transfers\r\n\r\n{3-c-6-Interp-1}\r\n1. *Written plan or agreement.* A transfer that the consumer initiates by telephone is covered by Regulation E if the transfer is made under a written plan or agreement between the consumer and the financial institution making the transfer. A written statement available to the public or to account holders that describes a service allowing a consumer to initiate transfers by telephone constitutes a plan; for example, a brochure, or material included with periodic statements. The following, however, do not by themselves constitute a written plan or agreement:\r\n\r\n{3-c-6-Interp-1-i}\r\ni. A hold-harmless agreement on a signature card that protects the institution if the consumer requests a transfer.\r\n\r\n{3-c-6-Interp-1-ii}\r\nii. A legend on a signature card, periodic statement, or passbook that limits the number of telephone-initiated transfers the consumer can make from a savings account because of reserve requirements under Regulation D of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (12 CFR part 204).\r\n\r\n{3-c-6-Interp-1-iii}\r\niii. An agreement permitting the consumer to approve by telephone the rollover of funds at the maturity of an instrument.\r\n\r\n{3-c-6-Interp-2}\r\n2. *Examples of covered transfers.* When a written plan or agreement has been entered into, a transfer initiated by a telephone call from a consumer is covered even though:\r\n\r\n{3-c-6-Interp-2-i}\r\ni. An employee of the financial institution completes the transfer manually (for example, by means of a debit memo or deposit slip).\r\n\r\n{3-c-6-Interp-2-ii}\r\nii. The consumer is required to make a separate request for each transfer.\r\n\r\n{3-c-6-Interp-2-iii}\r\niii. The consumer uses the plan infrequently.\r\n\r\n{3-c-6-Interp-2-iv}\r\niv. The consumer initiates the transfer via a facsimile machine.\r\n\r\n{3-c-6-Interp-2-v}\r\nv. The consumer initiates the transfer using a financial institution's audio-response or voice-response telephone system.\r\n\r\n{3-c-7-Interp}\r\n#### 3(c)(7) Small Institutions\r\n\r\n{3-c-7-Interp-1}\r\n1. *Coverage.* This exemption is limited to preauthorized transfers; institutions that offer other EFTs must comply with the applicable sections of the regulation as to such services. The preauthorized transfers remain subject to sections 913, 916, and 917 of the Act and \u00a7 1005.10(e), and are therefore exempt from UCC Article 4A.\r\n\r\n",

        "contents": "{5-Interp}\r\n### Section 1005.5 Issuance of Access Devices\r\n\r\n{5-Interp-1}\r\n1. *Coverage.* The provisions of this section limit the circumstances under which a financial institution may issue an access device to a consumer. Making an additional account accessible through an existing access device is equivalent to issuing an access device and is subject to the limitations of this section.\r\n\r\n{5-a-Interp}\r\n#### 5(a) Solicited Issuance\r\n\r\n{5-a-1-Interp}\r\nParagraph 5(a)(1)\r\n\r\n{5-a-1-Interp-1}\r\n1. *Joint account.* For a joint account, a financial institution may issue an access device to each account holder if the requesting holder specifically authorizes the issuance.\r\n\r\n{5-a-1-Interp-2}\r\n2. *Permissible forms of request.* The request for an access device may be written or oral (for example, in response to a telephone solicitation by a card issuer).\r\n\r\n{5-a-2-Interp}\r\n#### Paragraph 5(a)(2)\r\n\r\n{5-a-2-Interp-1}\r\n1. *One-for-one rule.* In issuing a renewal or substitute access device, only one renewal or substitute device may replace a previously issued device. For example, only one new card and PIN may replace a card and PIN previously issued. A financial institution may provide additional devices at the time it issues the renewal or substitute access device, however, provided the institution complies with \u00a7 1005.5(b). *See* comment 5(b)-5. If the replacement device or the additional device permits either fewer or additional types of electronic fund transfer services, a change-in-terms notice or new disclosures are required.\r\n\r\n{5-a-2-Interp-2}\r\n2. *Renewal or substitution by a successor institution.* A successor institution is an entity that replaces the original financial institution (for example, following a corporate merger or acquisition) or that acquires accounts or assumes the operation of an EFT system.\r\n\r\n{5-b-Interp}\r\n#### 5(b) Unsolicited Issuance\r\n\r\n{5-b-Interp-1}\r\n1. *Compliance.* A financial institution may issue an unsolicited access device (such as the combination of a debit card and PIN) if the institution's ATM system has been programmed not to accept the access device until after the consumer requests and the institution validates the device. Merely instructing a consumer not to use an unsolicited debit card and PIN until after the institution verifies the consumer's identity does not comply with the regulation.\r\n\r\n{5-b-Interp-2}\r\n2. *PINs.* A financial institution may impose no liability on a consumer for unauthorized transfers involving an unsolicited access device until the device becomes an \u201caccepted access device\u201d under the regulation. A card and PIN combination may be treated as an accepted access device once the consumer has used it to make a transfer.\r\n\r\n{5-b-Interp-3}\r\n3. *Functions of PIN.* If an institution issues a PIN at the consumer's request, the issuance may constitute both a way of validating the debit card and the means to identify the consumer (required as a condition of imposing liability for unauthorized transfers).\r\n\r\n{5-b-Interp-4}\r\n4. *Verification of identity.* To verify the consumer's identity, a financial institution may use any reasonable means, such as a photograph, fingerprint, personal visit, signature comparison, or personal information about the consumer. However, even if reasonable means were used, if an institution fails to verify correctly the consumer's identity and an imposter succeeds in having the device validated, the consumer is not liable for any unauthorized transfers from the account.\r\n\r\n{5-b-Interp-5}\r\n5. *Additional access devices in a renewal or substitution.* A financial institution may issue more than one access device in connection with the renewal or substitution of a previously issued accepted access device, provided that any additional access device (beyond the device replacing the accepted access device) is not validated at the time it is issued, and the institution complies with the other requirements of \u00a7 1005.5(b). The institution may, if it chooses, set up the validation procedure such that both the device replacing the previously issued device and the additional device are not validated at the time they are issued, and validation will apply to both devices. If the institution sets up the validation procedure in this way, the institution should provide a clear and readily understandable disclosure to the consumer that both devices are unvalidated and that validation will apply to both devices.\r\n\r\n",

        "subpart": 7,
        "contents": "{6-Interp}\r\n### Section 1005.6 Liability of Consumer for Unauthorized Transfers\r\n\r\n{6-a-Interp}\r\n#### 6(a) Conditions for Liability\r\n\r\n{6-a-Interp-1}\r\n1. *Means of identification.* A financial institution may use various means for identifying the consumer to whom the access device is issued, including but not limited to:\r\n\r\n{6-a-Interp-1-i}\r\ni. Electronic or mechanical confirmation (such as a PIN).\r\n\r\n{6-a-Interp-1--ii}\r\nii. Comparison of the consumer's signature, fingerprint, or photograph.\r\n\r\n{6-a-Interp-2}\r\n2. *Multiple users.* When more than one access device is issued for an account, the financial institution may, but need not, provide a separate means to identify each user of the account.\r\n\r\n{6-b-Interp}\r\n#### 6(b) Limitations on Amount of Liability\r\n\r\n{6-b-Interp-1}\r\n1. *Application of liability provisions.* There are three possible tiers of consumer liability for unauthorized EFTs depending on the situation. A consumer may be liable for: (1) up to $50; (2) up to $500; or (3) an unlimited amount depending on when the unauthorized EFT occurs. More than one tier may apply to a given situation because each corresponds to a different (sometimes overlapping) time period or set of conditions.\r\n\r\n{6-b-Interp-2}\r\n2. *Consumer negligence.* Negligence by the consumer cannot be used as the basis for imposing greater liability than is permissible under Regulation E. Thus, consumer behavior that may constitute negligence under state law, such as writing the PIN on a debit card or on a piece of paper kept with the card, does not affect the consumer's liability for unauthorized transfers. (However, refer to comment 2(m)-2 regarding termination of the authority of given by the consumer to another person.)\r\n\r\n{6-b-Interp-3}\r\n3. *Limits on liability.* The extent of the consumer's liability is determined solely by the consumer's promptness in reporting the loss or theft of an access device. Similarly, no agreement between the consumer and an institution may impose greater liability on the consumer for an unauthorized transfer than the limits provided in Regulation E.\r\n\r\n{6-b-1-Interp}\r\n#### 6(b)(1) Timely Notice Given\r\n\r\n{6-b-1-Interp-1}\r\n1. *$50 limit applies.* The basic liability limit is $50. For example, the consumer's card is lost or stolen on Monday and the consumer learns of the loss or theft on Wednesday. If the consumer notifies the financial institution within two business days of learning of the loss or theft (by midnight Friday), the consumer's liability is limited to $50 or the amount of the unauthorized transfers that occurred before notification, whichever is less.\r\n\r\n{6-b-1-Interp-2}\r\n2. *Knowledge of loss or theft of access device.* The fact that a consumer has received a periodic statement that reflects unauthorized transfers may be a factor in determining whether the consumer had knowledge of the loss or theft, but cannot be deemed to represent conclusive evidence that the consumer had such knowledge.\r\n\r\n{6-b-1-Interp-3}\r\n3. *Two business day rule.* The two business day period does not include the day the consumer learns of the loss or theft or any day that is not a business day. The rule is calculated based on two 24-hour periods, without regard to the financial institution's business hours or the time of day that the consumer learns of the loss or theft. For example, a consumer learns of the loss or theft at 6 p.m. on Friday. Assuming that Saturday is a business day and Sunday is not, the two business day period begins on Saturday and expires at 11:59 p.m. on Monday, not at the end of the financial institution's business day on Monday.\r\n\r\n{6-b-2-Interp}\r\n#### 6(b)(2) Timely Notice Not Given\r\n\r\n{6-b-2-Interp-1}\r\n1. *$500 limit applies.* The second tier of liability is $500. For example, the consumer's card is stolen on Monday and the consumer learns of the theft that same day. The consumer reports the theft on Friday. The $500 limit applies because the consumer failed to notify the financial institution within two business days of learning of the theft (which would have been by midnight Wednesday). How much the consumer is actually liable for, however, depends on when the unauthorized transfers take place. In this example, assume a $100 unauthorized transfer was made on Tuesday and a $600 unauthorized transfer on Thursday. Because the consumer is liable for the amount of the loss that occurs within the first two business days (but no more than $50), plus the amount of the unauthorized transfers that occurs after the first two business days and before the consumer gives notice, the consumer's total liability is $500 ($50 of the $100 transfer plus $450 of the $600 transfer, in this example). But if $600 was taken on Tuesday and $100 on Thursday, the consumer's maximum liability would be $150 ($50 of the $600 plus $100).\r\n\r\n{6-b-3-Interp}\r\n#### 6(b)(3) Periodic Statement; Timely Notice Not Given\r\n\r\n{6-b-3-Interp-1}\r\n1. *Unlimited liability applies.* The standard of unlimited liability applies if unauthorized transfers appear on a periodic statement, and may apply in conjunction with the first two tiers of liability. If a periodic statement shows an unauthorized transfer made with a lost or stolen debit card, the consumer must notify the financial institution within 60 calendar days after the periodic statement was sent; otherwise, the consumer faces unlimited liability for all unauthorized transfers made after the 60-day period. The consumer's liability for unauthorized transfers before the statement is sent, and up to 60 days following, is determined based on the first two tiers of liability: up to $50 if the consumer notifies the financial institution within two business days of learning of the loss or theft of the card and up to $500 if the consumer notifies the institution after two business days of learning of the loss or theft.\r\n\r\n{6-b-3-Interp-2}\r\n2. *Transfers not involving access device.* The first two tiers of liability do not apply to unauthorized transfers from a consumer's account made without an access device. If, however, the consumer fails to report such unauthorized transfers within 60 calendar days of the financial institution's transmittal of the periodic statement, the consumer may be liable for any transfers occurring after the close of the 60 days and before notice is given to the institution. For example, a consumer's account is electronically debited for $200 without the consumer's authorization and by means other than the consumer's access device. If the consumer notifies the institution within 60 days of the transmittal of the periodic statement that shows the unauthorized transfer, the consumer has no liability. However, if in addition to the $200, the consumer's account is debited for a $400 unauthorized transfer on the 61st day and the consumer fails to notify the institution of the first unauthorized transfer until the 62nd day, the consumer may be liable for the full $400.\r\n\r\n{6-b-4-Interp}\r\n#### 6(b)(4) Extension of Time Limits\r\n\r\n{6-b-4-Interp-1}\r\n1. *Extenuating circumstances.* Examples of circumstances that require extension of the notification periods under this section include the consumer's extended travel or hospitalization.\r\n\r\n{6-b-5-Interp}\r\n#### 6(b)(5) Notice to Financial Institution\r\n\r\n{6-b-5-Interp-1}\r\n1. *Receipt of notice.* A financial institution is considered to have received notice for purposes of limiting the consumer's liability if notice is given in a reasonable manner, even if the consumer notifies the institution but uses an address or telephone number other than the one specified by the institution.\r\n\r\n{6-b-5-Interp-2}\r\n2. *Notice by third party.* Notice to a financial institution by a person acting on the consumer's behalf is considered valid under this section. For example, if a consumer is hospitalized and unable to report the loss or theft of an access device, notice is considered given when someone acting on the consumer's behalf notifies the bank of the loss or theft. A financial institution may require appropriate documentation from the person representing the consumer to establish that the person is acting on the consumer's behalf.\r\n\r\n{6-b-5-Interp-3}\r\n3. *Content of notice.* Notice to a financial institution is considered given when a consumer takes reasonable steps to provide the institution with the pertinent account information. Even when the consumer is unable to provide the account number or the card number in reporting a lost or stolen access device or an unauthorized transfer, the notice effectively limits the consumer's liability if the consumer otherwise identifies sufficiently the account in question. For example, the consumer may identify the account by the name on the account and the type of account in question.\r\n\r\n",

        "contents": "{7-Interp}\r\n### Section 1005.7 Initial Disclosures\r\n\r\n{7-a-Interp}\r\n#### 7(a) Timing of Disclosures\r\n\r\n{7-a-Interp-1}\r\n1. *Early disclosures.* Disclosures given by a financial institution earlier than the regulation requires (for example, when the consumer opens a checking account) need not be repeated when the consumer later enters into an agreement with a third party to initiate preauthorized transfers to or from the consumer's account, unless the terms and conditions differ from those that the institution previously disclosed. This interpretation also applies to any notice provided about one-time EFTs from a consumer's account initiated using information from the consumer's check. On the other hand, if an agreement for EFT services to be provided by an account-holding institution is directly between the consumer and the account-holding institution, disclosures must be given in close proximity to the event requiring disclosure, for example, when the consumer contracts for a new service.\r\n\r\n{7-a-Interp-2}\r\n2. *Lack of advance notice of a transfer.* Where a consumer authorizes a third party to debit or credit the consumer's account, an account-holding institution that has not received advance notice of the transfer or transfers must provide the required disclosures as soon as reasonably possible after the first debit or credit is made, unless the institution has previously given the disclosures.\r\n\r\n{7-a-Interp-3}\r\n3. *Addition of new accounts.* If a consumer opens a new account permitting EFTs at a financial institution, and the consumer already has received Regulation E disclosures for another account at that institution, the institution need only disclose terms and conditions that differ from those previously given.\r\n\r\n{7-a-Interp-4}\r\n4. *Addition of service in interchange systems.* If a financial institution joins an interchange or shared network system (which provides access to terminals operated by other institutions), disclosures are required for additional EFT services not previously available to consumers if the terms and conditions differ from those previously disclosed.\r\n\r\n{7-a-Interp-5}\r\n5. *Disclosures covering all EFT services offered.* An institution may provide disclosures covering all EFT services that it offers, even if some consumers have not arranged to use all services.\r\n\r\n{7-b-Interp}\r\n#### 7(b) Content of Disclosures\r\n\r\n{7-b-1-Interp}\r\n#### 7(b)(1) Liability of Consumer\r\n\r\n{7-b-1-Interp-1}\r\n1. *No liability imposed by financial institution.* If a financial institution chooses to impose zero liability for unauthorized EFTs, it need not provide the liability disclosures. If the institution later decides to impose liability, however, it must first provide the disclosures.\r\n\r\n{7-b-1-Interp-2}\r\n2. *Preauthorized transfers.* If the only EFTs from an account are preauthorized transfers, liability could arise if the consumer fails to report unauthorized transfers reflected on a periodic statement. To impose such liability on the consumer, the institution must have disclosed the potential liability and the telephone number and address for reporting unauthorized transfers.\r\n\r\n{7-b-1-Interp-3}\r\n3. *Additional information.* At the institution's option, the summary of the consumer's liability may include advice on promptly reporting unauthorized transfers or the loss or theft of the access device.\r\n\r\n{7-b-2-Interp}\r\n#### 7(b)(2) Telephone Number and Address\r\n\r\n{7-b-2-Interp-1}\r\n1. *Disclosure of telephone numbers.* An institution may use the same or different telephone numbers in the disclosures for the purpose of:\r\n\r\n{7-b-2-Interp-1-i}\r\ni. Reporting the loss or theft of an access device or possible unauthorized transfers;\r\n\r\n{7-b-2-Interp-1-ii}\r\nii. Inquiring about the receipt of a preauthorized credit;\r\n\r\n{7-b-2-Interp-1-iii}\r\niii. Stopping payment of a preauthorized debit;\r\n\r\n{7-b-2-Interp-1-iv}\r\niv. Giving notice of an error.\r\n\r\n{7-b-2-Interp-2}\r\n2. *Location of telephone number.* The telephone number need not be incorporated into the text of the disclosure; for example, the institution may instead insert a reference to a telephone number that is readily available to the consumer, such as \u201cCall your branch office. The number is shown on your periodic statement.\u201d However, an institution must provide a specific telephone number and address, on or with the disclosure statement, for reporting a lost or stolen access device or a possible unauthorized transfer.\r\n\r\n{7-b-4-Interp}\r\n#### 7(b)(4) Types of Transfers; Limitations\r\n\r\n{7-b-4-Interp-1}\r\n1. *Security limitations.* Information about limitations on the frequency and dollar amount of transfers generally must be disclosed in detail, even if related to security aspects of the system. If the confidentiality of certain details is essential to the security of an account or system, these details may be withheld (but the fact that limitations exist must still be disclosed). For example, an institution limits cash ATM withdrawals to $100 per day. The institution may disclose that daily withdrawal limitations apply and need not disclose that the limitations may not always be in force (such as during periods when its ATMs are off-line).\r\n\r\n{7-b-4-Interp-2}\r\n2. *Restrictions on certain deposit accounts.* A limitation on account activity that restricts the consumer's ability to make EFTs must be disclosed even if the restriction also applies to transfers made by non-electronic means. For example, Regulation D of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (12 CFR part 204) restricts the number of payments to third parties that may be made from a money market deposit account; an institution that does not execute fund transfers in excess of those limits must disclose the restriction as a limitation on the frequency of EFTs.\r\n\r\n{7-b-4-Interp-3}\r\n3. *Preauthorized transfers.* Financial institutions are not required to list preauthorized transfers among the types of transfers that a consumer can make.\r\n\r\n{7-b-4-Interp-4}\r\n4. *One-time EFTs initiated using information from a check.* Financial institutions must disclose the fact that one-time EFTs initiated using information from a consumer's check are among the types of transfers that a consumer can make. *See* appendix A-2.\r\n\r\n{7-b-5-Interp}\r\n#### 7(b)(5) Fees\r\n\r\n{7-b-5-Interp-1}\r\n1. *Disclosure of EFT fees.* An institution is required to disclose all fees for EFTs or the right to make them. Others fees (for example, minimum-balance fees, stop-payment fees, or account overdrafts) may, but need not, be disclosed. *But see* Regulation DD, 12 CFR part 1030. An institution is not required to disclose fees for inquiries made at an ATM since no transfer of funds is involved.\r\n\r\n{7-b-5-Interp-2}\r\n2. *Fees also applicable to non-EFT.* A per-item fee for EFTs must be disclosed even if the same fee is imposed on non-electronic transfers. If a per-item fee is imposed only under certain conditions, such as when the transactions in the cycle exceed a certain number, those conditions must be disclosed. Itemization of the various fees may be provided on the disclosure statement or on an accompanying document that is referenced in the statement.\r\n\r\n{7-b-5-Interp-3}\r\n3. *Interchange system fees.* Fees paid by the account-holding institution to the operator of a shared or interchange ATM system need not be disclosed, unless they are imposed on the consumer by the account-holding institution. Fees for use of an ATM that are debited directly from the consumer's account by an institution other than the account-holding institution (for example, fees included in the transfer amount) need not be disclosed. *See* \u00a7 1005.7(b)(11) for the general notice requirement regarding fees that may be imposed by ATM operators and by a network used to complete the transfer.\r\n\r\n{7-b-9-Interp}\r\n#### 7(b)(9) Confidentiality\r\n\r\n{7-b-9-Interp-1}\r\n1. *Information provided to third parties.* An institution must describe the circumstances under which any information relating to an account to or from which EFTs are permitted will be made available to third parties, not just information concerning those EFTs. The term \u201cthird parties\u201d includes affiliates such as other subsidiaries of the same holding company.\r\n\r\n{7-b-10-Interp}\r\n#### 7(b)(10) Error Resolution\r\n\r\n{7-b-10-Interp-1}\r\n1. *Substantially similar.* The error resolution notice must be substantially similar to the model form in appendix A of part 1005. An institution may use different wording so long as the substance of the notice remains the same, may delete inapplicable provisions (for example, the requirement for written confirmation of an oral notification), and may substitute substantive state law requirements affording greater consumer protection than Regulation E.\r\n\r\n{7-b-10-Interp-2}\r\n2. *Extended time-period for certain transactions.* To take advantage of the longer time periods for resolving errors under \u00a7 1005.11(c)(3) (for new accounts as defined in Regulation CC of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (12 CFR part 229), transfers initiated outside the United States, or transfers resulting from POS debit-card transactions), a financial institution must have disclosed these longer time periods. Similarly, an institution that relies on the exception from provisional crediting in \u00a7 1005.11(c)(2) for accounts subject to Regulation T of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (12 CFR part 220) must have disclosed accordingly.\r\n\r\n{7-c-Interp}\r\n#### 7(c) Addition of Electronic Fund Transfer Services\r\n\r\n{7-c-Interp-1}\r\n1. *Addition of electronic check conversion services.* One-time EFTs initiated using information from a consumer's check are a new type of transfer requiring new disclosures, as applicable. *See* appendix A-2.\r\n",

The notice may appear on a periodic statement, or may be given by sending a copy of a revised disclosure statement, provided attention is directed to the change (for example, in a cover letter referencing the changed term).\r\n\r\n{8-a-Interp-2}\r\n2. *Changes not requiring notice.* The following changes do not require disclosure:\r\n\r\n{8-a-Interp-2-i}\r\ni. Closing some of an institution's ATMs;\r\n\r\n{8-a-Interp-2-ii}\r\nii. Cancellation of an access device.\r\n\r\n{8-a-Interp-3}\r\n3. *Limitations on transfers.* When the initial disclosures omit details about limitations because secrecy is essential to the security of the account or system, a subsequent increase in those limitations need not be disclosed if secrecy is still essential. If, however, an institution had no limits in place when the initial disclosures were given and now wishes to impose limits for the first time, it must disclose at least the fact that limits have been adopted. *See also* \u00a7 1005.7(b)(4) and the related commentary.\r\n\r\n{8-a-Interp-4}\r\n4. *Change in telephone number or address.* When a financial institution changes the telephone number or address used for reporting possible unauthorized transfers, a change-in-terms notice is required only if the institution will impose liability on the consumer for unauthorized transfers under \u00a7 1005.6. *See also* \u00a7 1005.6(a) and the related commentary.\r\n\r\n{8-b-Interp}\r\n#### 8(b) Error Resolution Notice\r\n\r\n{8-b-Interp-1}\r\n1. *Change between annual and periodic notice.* If an institution switches from an annual to a periodic notice, or vice versa, the first notice under the new method must be sent no later than 12 months after the last notice sent under the old method.\r\n\r\n{8-b-Interp-2}\r\n2. *Exception for new accounts.* For new accounts, disclosure of the longer error resolution time periods under \u00a7 1005.11(c)(3) is not required in the annual error resolution notice or in the notice that may be provided with each periodic statement as an alternative to the annual notice.\r\n",

        "subpart": 7,
        "contents": "{9-Interp}\r\n### Section 1005.9 Receipts at Electronic Terminals; Periodic Statements\r\n\r\n{9-a-Interp}\r\n#### 9(a) Receipts at Electronic Terminals\r\n\r\n{9-a-Interp}-1}\r\n1. *Receipts furnished only on request.* The regulation requires that a receipt be \u201cmade available.\u201d A financial institution may program its electronic terminals to provide a receipt only to consumers who elect to receive one.\r\n\r\n{9-a-Interp}-2}\r\n2. *Third party providing receipt.* An account-holding institution may make terminal receipts available through third parties such as merchants or other financial institutions.\r\n\r\n{9-a-Interp}-3}\r\n3. *Inclusion of promotional material.* A financial institution may include promotional material on receipts if the required information is set forth clearly (for example, by separating it from the promotional material). In addition, a consumer may not be required to surrender the receipt or that portion containing the required disclosures in order to take advantage of a promotion.\r\n\r\n{9-a-Interp}-4}\r\n4. *Transfer not completed.* The receipt requirement does not apply to a transfer that is initiated but not completed (for example, if the ATM is out of currency or the consumer decides not to complete the transfer).\r\n\r\n{9-a-Interp}-5}\r\n5. *Receipts not furnished due to inadvertent error.* If a receipt is not provided to the consumer because of a bona fide unintentional error, such as when a terminal runs out of paper or the mechanism jams, no violation results if the financial institution maintains procedures reasonably adapted to avoid such occurrences.\r\n\r\n{9-a-Interp}-6}\r\n6. *Multiple transfers.* If the consumer makes multiple transfers at the same time, the financial institution may document them on a single or on separate receipts.\r\n\r\n{9-a-1-Interp}\r\n#### 9(a)(1) Amount\r\n\r\n{9-a-1-Interp-1}\r\n1. *Disclosure of transaction fee.* The required display of a fee amount on or at the terminal may be accomplished by displaying the fee on a sign at the terminal or on the terminal screen for a reasonable duration. Displaying the fee on a screen provides adequate notice, as long as a consumer is given the option to cancel the transaction after receiving notice of a fee. *See* \u00a7 1005.16 for the notice requirements applicable to ATM operators that impose a fee for providing EFT services.\r\n\r\n{9-a-1-Interp-2}\r\n2. *Relationship between \u00a7 1005.9(a)(1) and \u00a7 1005.16.* The requirements of \u00a7\u00a7 1005.9(a)(1) and 1005.16 are similar but not identical.\r\n\r\n{9-a-1-Interp-2-i}\r\ni. Section 1005.9(a)(1) requires that if the amount of the transfer as shown on the receipt will include the fee, then the fee must be disclosed either on a sign on or at the terminal, or on the terminal screen. Section 1005.16 requires disclosure both on a sign on or at the terminal (in a prominent and conspicuous location) and on the terminal screen. Section 1005.16 permits disclosure on a paper notice as an alternative to the on-screen disclosure.\r\n\r\n{9-a-1-Interp-2-ii}\r\nii. The disclosure of the fee on the receipt under \u00a7 1005.9(a)(1) cannot be used to comply with the alternative paper disclosure procedure under \u00a7 1005.16, if the receipt is provided at the completion of the transaction because, pursuant to the statute, the paper notice must be provided before the consumer is committed to paying the fee.\r\n\r\n{9-a-1-Interp-2-iii}\r\niii. Section 1005.9(a)(1) applies to any type of electronic terminal as defined in Regulation E (for example, to POS terminals as well as to ATMs), while \u00a7 1005.16 applies only to ATMs.\r\n\r\n{9-a-2-Interp}\r\n#### 9(a)(2) Date\r\n\r\n{9-a-2-Interp-1}\r\n1. *Calendar date.* The receipt must disclose the calendar date on which the consumer uses the electronic terminal. An accounting or business date may be disclosed in addition if the dates are clearly distinguished.\r\n\r\n{9-a-3-Interp}\r\n#### 9(a)(3) Type\r\n\r\n{9-a-3-Interp-1}\r\n1. *Identifying transfer and account.* Examples identifying the type of transfer and the type of the consumer's account include \u201cwithdrawal from checking,\u201d \u201ctransfer from savings to checking,\u201d or \u201cpayment from savings.\u201d\r\n\r\n{9-a-3-Interp-2}\r\n2. *Exception.* Identification of an account is not required when the consumer can access only one asset account at a particular time or terminal, even if the access device can normally be used to access more than one account. For example, the consumer may be able to access only one particular account at terminals not operated by the account-holding institution, or may be able to access only one particular account when the terminal is off-line. The exception is available even if, in addition to accessing one asset account, the consumer also can access a credit line.\r\n\r\n{9-a-3-Interp-3}\r\n3. *Access to multiple accounts.* If the consumer can use an access device to make transfers to or from different accounts of the same type, the terminal receipt must specify which account was accessed, such as \u201cwithdrawal from checking I\u201d or \u201cwithdrawal from checking II.\u201d If only one account besides the primary checking account can be debited, the receipt can identify the account as \u201cwithdrawal from other account.\u201d\r\n\r\n{9-a-3-Interp-4}\r\n4. *Generic descriptions.* Generic descriptions may be used for accounts that are similar in function, such as share draft or NOW accounts and checking accounts. In a shared system, for example, when a credit union member initiates transfers to or from a share draft account at a terminal owned or operated by a bank, the receipt may identify a withdrawal from the account as a \u201cwithdrawal from checking.\u201d\r\n\r\n{9-a-3-Interp-5}\r\n5. *Point-of-sale transactions.* There is no prescribed terminology for identifying a transfer at a merchant's POS terminal. A transfer may be identified, for example, as a purchase, a sale of goods or services, or a payment to a third party. When a consumer obtains cash from a POS terminal in addition to purchasing goods, or obtains cash only, the documentation need not differentiate the transaction from one involving the purchase of goods.\r\n\r\n{9-a-5-Interp}\r\n#### 9(a)(5) Terminal Location\r\n\r\n{9-a-5-Interp-1}\r\n1. *Options for identifying terminal.* The institution may provide either:\r\n\r\n{9-a-5-Interp-1-i}\r\ni. The city, state or foreign country, and the information in \u00a7 1005.9(a)(5) (i), (ii), or (iii), or\r\n\r\n{9-a-5-Interp-1-ii}\r\nii. A number or a code identifying the terminal. If the institution chooses the second option, the code or terminal number identifying the terminal where the transfer is initiated may be given as part of a transaction code.\r\n\r\n{9-a-5-Interp-2}\r\n2. *Omission of city name.* The city may be omitted if the generally accepted name (such as a branch name) contains the city name.\r\n\r\n{9-a-5-Interp--3}\r\n3. *Omission of a state.* A state may be omitted from the location information on the receipt if:\r\n\r\n{9-a-5-Interp--3-i}\r\ni. All the terminals owned or operated by the financial institution providing the statement (or by the system in which it participates) are located in that state, or\r\n\r\n{9-a-5-Interp--3-ii}\r\nii. All transfers occur at terminals located within 50 miles of the financial institution's main office.\r\n\r\n{9-a-5-Interp-4}\r\n4. *Omission of a city and state.* A city and state may be omitted if all the terminals owned or operated by the financial institution providing the statement (or by the system in which it participates) are located in the same city.\r\n\r\n{9-a-5-i-Interp}\r\n#### Paragraph 9(a)(5)(i)\r\n\r\n{9-a-5-i-Interp-1}\r\n1. *Street address.* The address should include number and street (or intersection); the number (or intersecting street) may be omitted if the street alone uniquely identifies the terminal location.\r\n\r\n{9-a-5-ii-Interp}\r\n#### Paragraph 9(a)(5)(ii)\r\n\r\n{9-a-5-ii-Interp-1}\r\n1. *Generally accepted name.* Examples of a generally accepted name for a specific location include a branch of the financial institution, a shopping center, or an airport.\r\n\r\n{9-a-5-iii-Interp}\r\n#### Paragraph 9(a)(5)(iii)\r\n\r\n{9-a-5-iii-Interp-1}\r\n1. *Name of owner or operator of terminal.* Examples of an owner or operator of a terminal are a financial institution or a retail merchant.\r\n\r\n{9-a-6-Interp}\r\n#### 9(a)(6) Third Party Transfer\r\n\r\n{9-a-6-Interp-1}\r\n1. *Omission of third-party name.* The receipt need not disclose the third-party name if the name is provided by the consumer in a form that is not machine readable (for example, if the consumer indicates the payee by depositing a payment stub into the ATM). If, on the other hand, the consumer keys in the identity of the payee, the receipt must identify the payee by name or by using a code that is explained elsewhere on the receipt.\r\n\r\n{9-a-6-Interp-2}\r\n2. *Receipt as proof of payment.* Documentation required under the regulation constitutes prima facie proof of a payment to another person, except in the case of a terminal receipt documenting a deposit.\r\n\r\n{9-b-Interp}\r\n#### 9(b) Periodic Statements\r\n\r\n{9-b-Interp-1}\r\n1. *Periodic cycles.* Periodic statements may be sent on a cycle that is shorter than monthly. The statements must correspond to periodic cycles that are reasonably equal, that is, do not vary by more than four days from the regular cycle. The requirement of reasonably equal cycles does not apply when an institution changes cycles for operational or other reasons, such as to establish a new statement day or date.\r\n\r\n{9-b-Interp-2}\r\n2. *Interim statements.* Generally, a financial institution must provide periodic statements for each monthly cycle in which an EFT occurs, and at least quarterly if a transfer has not occurred. Where EFTs occur between regularly-scheduled cycles, interim statements must be provided. For example, if an institution issues quarterly statements at the end of March, June, September and December, and the consumer initiates an EFT in February, an interim statement for February must be provided. If an interim statement contains interest or rate information, the institution must comply with Regulation DD, 12 CFR 1030.6.\r\n\r\n{9-b-Interp-3}\r\n3. *Inactive accounts.* A financial institution need not send statements to consumers whose accounts are inactive as defined by the institution.\r\n\r\n{9-b-Interp-4}\r\n4. *Statement pickup.* A financial institution may permit, but may not require, consumers to pick up their periodic statements at the financial institution.\r\n\r\n{9-b-Interp-5}\r\n5. *Periodic statements limited to EFT activity.* A financial institution that uses a passbook as the primary means for displaying account activity, but also allows the account to be debited electronically, may provide a periodic statement requirement that reflects only the EFTs and other required disclosures (such as charges, account balances, and address and telephone number for inquiries). *See* \u00a7 1005.9(c)(1)(i) for the exception applicable to preauthorized transfers for passbook accounts.\r\n\r\n{9-b-Interp-6}\r\n6. *Codes and accompanying documents.* To meet the documentation requirements for periodic statements, a financial institution may:\r\n\r\n{9-b-Interp-6-i}\r\ni. Include copies of terminal receipts to reflect transfers initiated by the consumer at electronic terminals;\r\n\r\n{9-b-Interp-6-ii}\r\nii. Enclose posting memos, deposit slips, and other documents that, together with the statement, disclose all the required information;\r\n\r\n{9-b-Interp-6-iii}\r\niii. Use codes for names of third parties or terminal locations and explain the information to which the codes relate on an accompanying document.\r\n\r\n{9-b-1-Interp}\r\n#### 9(b)(1) Transaction Information\r\n\r\n{9-b-1-Interp-1}\r\n1. *Information obtained from others.* While financial institutions must maintain reasonable procedures to ensure the integrity of data obtained from another institution, a merchant, or other third parties, verification of each transfer that appears on the periodic statement is not required.\r\n\r\n{9-b-1-i-Interp}\r\n#### Paragraph 9(b)(1)(i)\r\n\r\n{9-b-1-i-Interp-1}\r\n1. *Incorrect deposit amount.* If a financial institution determines that the amount actually deposited at an ATM is different from the amount entered by the consumer, the institution need not immediately notify the consumer of the discrepancy. The periodic statement reflecting the deposit may show either the correct amount of the deposit or the amount entered by the consumer along with the institution's adjustment.\r\n\r\n{9-b-1-iii-Interp}\r\n#### Paragraph 9(b)(1)(iii)\r\n\r\n{9-b-1-iii-Interp-1}\r\n1. *Type of transfer.* There is no prescribed terminology for describing a type of transfer. Placement of the amount of the transfer in the debit or the credit column is sufficient if other information on the statement, such as a terminal location or third-party name, enables the consumer to identify the type of transfer.\r\n\r\n{9-b-1-iv-Interp}\r\n#### Paragraph 9(b)(1)(iv)\r\n\r\n{9-b-1-iv-Interp-1}\r\n1. *Nonproprietary terminal in network.* An institution need not reflect on the periodic statement the street addresses, identification codes, or terminal numbers for transfers initiated in a shared or interchange system at a terminal operated by an institution other than the account-holding institution. The statement must, however, specify the entity that owns or operates the terminal, plus the city and state.\r\n\r\n{9-b-1-v-Interp}\r\n#### Paragraph 9(b)(1)(v)\r\n\r\n{9-b-1-v-Interp-1}\r\n1. *Recurring payments by government agency.* The third-party name for recurring payments from Federal, state, or local governments need not list the particular agency. For example, \u201cU.S. gov't\u201d or \u201cN.Y. sal\u201d will suffice.\r\n\r\n{9-b-1-v-Interp-2}\r\n2. *Consumer as third-party payee.* If a consumer makes an electronic fund transfer to another consumer, the financial institution must identify the recipient by name (not just by an account number, for example).\r\n\r\n{9-b-1-v-Interp-3}\r\n3. *Terminal location/third party.* A single entry may be used to identify both the terminal location and the name of the third party to or from whom funds are transferred. For example, if a consumer purchases goods from a merchant, the name of the party to whom funds are transferred (the merchant) and the location of the terminal where the transfer is initiated will be satisfied by a disclosure such as \u201cXYZ Store, Anytown, Ohio.\u201d\r\n\r\n{9-b-1-v-Interp-4}\r\n4. *Account-holding institution as third party.* Transfers to the account-holding institution (by ATM, for example) must show the institution as the recipient, unless other information on the statement (such as, \u201cloan payment from checking\u201d) clearly indicates that the payment was to the account-holding institution.\r\n\r\n{9-b-1-v-Interp-5}\r\n5. *Consistency in third-party identity.* The periodic statement must disclose a third-party name as it appeared on the receipt, whether it was, for example, the \u201cdba\u201d (doing business as) name of the third party or the parent corporation's name.\r\n\r\n{9-b-1-v-Interp-6}\r\n6. *Third-party identity on deposits at electronic terminal.* A financial institution need not identify third parties whose names appear on checks, drafts, or similar paper instruments deposited to the consumer's account at an electronic terminal.\r\n\r\n{9-b-3-Interp}\r\n#### 9(b)(3) Fees\r\n\r\n{9-b-3-Interp-1}\r\n1. *Disclosure of fees.* The fees disclosed may include fees for EFTs and for other non-electronic services, and both fixed fees and per-item fees; they may be given as a total or may be itemized in part or in full.\r\n\r\n{9-b-3-Interp-2}\r\n2. *Fees in interchange system.* An account-holding institution must disclose any fees it imposes on the consumer for EFTs, including fees for ATM transactions in an interchange or shared ATM system. Fees for use of an ATM imposed on the consumer by an institution other than the account-holding institution and included in the amount of the transfer by the terminal-operating institution need not be separately disclosed on the periodic statement.\r\n\r\n{9-b-3-Interp-3}\r\n3. *Finance charges.* The requirement to disclose any fees assessed against the account does not include a finance charge imposed on the account during the statement period.\r\n\r\n{9-b-4-Interp}\r\n#### 9(b)(4) Account Balances\r\n\r\n{9-b-4-Interp-1}\r\n1. *Opening and closing balances.* The opening and closing balances must reflect both EFTs and other account activity.\r\n\r\n{9-b-5-Interp}\r\n#### 9(b)(5) Address and Telephone Number for Inquiries\r\n\r\n{9-b-5-Interp-1}\r\n1. *Telephone number.* A single telephone number, preceded by the \u201cdirect inquiries to\u201d language, will satisfy the requirements of \u00a7\u00a7 1005.9(b)(5) and (6).\r\n\r\n{9-b-6-Interp}\r\n#### 9(b)(6) Telephone Number for Preauthorized Transfers\r\n\r\n{9-b-6-Interp-1}\r\n1. *Telephone number. See* comment 9(b)(5)-1.\r\n\r\n{9-c-Interp}\r\n#### 9(c) Exceptions to the Periodic Statement Requirements for Certain Accounts\r\n\r\n{9-c-Interp-1}\r\n1. *Transfers between accounts.* The regulation provides an exception from the periodic statement requirement for certain intra-institutional transfers between a consumer's accounts. The financial institution must still comply with the applicable periodic statement requirements for any other EFTs to or from the account. For example, a Regulation E statement must be provided quarterly for an account that also receives payroll deposits electronically, or for any month in which an account is also accessed by a withdrawal at an ATM.\r\n\r\n{9-c-1-Interp}\r\n#### 9(c)(1) Preauthorized Transfers to Accounts\r\n\r\n{9-c-1-Interp-1}\r\n1. *Accounts that may be accessed only by preauthorized transfers to the account.* The exception for \u201caccounts that may be accessed only by preauthorized transfers to the account\u201d includes accounts that can be accessed by means other than EFTs, such as checks. If, however, an account may be accessed by any EFT other than preauthorized credits to the account, such as preauthorized debits or ATM transactions, the account does not qualify for the exception.\r\n\r\n{9-c-1-Interp-2}\r\n2. *Reversal of direct deposits.* For direct-deposit-only accounts, a financial institution must send a periodic statement at least quarterly. A reversal of a direct deposit to correct an error does not trigger the monthly statement requirement when the error represented a credit to the wrong consumer's account, a duplicate credit, or a credit in the wrong amount. *See also* comment 2(m)-5.\r\n\r\n{9-d-Interp}\r\n#### 9(d) Documentation for Foreign-Initiated Transfers\r\n\r\n{9-d-Interp-1}\r\n1. *Foreign-initiated transfers.* An institution must make a good faith effort to provide all required information for foreign-initiated transfers. For example, even if the institution is not able to provide a specific terminal location, it should identify the country and city in which the transfer was initiated.\r\n",

        "contents": "{10-Interp}\r\n### Section 1005.10 Preauthorized Transfers\r\n\r\n{10-a-Interp}\r\n#### 10(a) Preauthorized Transfers to Consumer's Account\r\n\r\n{10-a-1-Interp}\r\n#### 10(a)(1) Notice by Financial Institution\r\n\r\n{10-a-1-Interp-1}\r\n1. *Content.* No specific language is required for notice regarding receipt of a preauthorized transfer. Identifying the deposit is sufficient; however, simply providing the current account balance is not.\r\n\r\n{10-a-1-Interp-2}\r\n2. *Notice of credit.* A financial institution may use different methods of notice for various types or series of preauthorized transfers, and the institution need not offer consumers a choice of notice methods.\r\n\r\n{10-a-1-Interp-3}\r\n3. *Positive notice.* A periodic statement sent within two business days of the scheduled transfer, showing the transfer, can serve as notice of receipt.\r\n\r\n{10-a-1-Interp-4}\r\n4. *Negative notice.* The absence of a deposit entry (on a periodic statement sent within two business days of the scheduled transfer date) will serve as negative notice.\r\n\r\n{10-a-1-Interp-5}\r\n5. *Telephone notice.* If a financial institution uses the telephone notice option, the institution should be able in most instances to verify during a consumer's initial call whether a transfer was received. The institution must respond within two business days to any inquiry not answered immediately.\r\n\r\n{10-a-1-Interp-6}\r\n6. *Phone number for passbook accounts.* The financial institution may use any reasonable means necessary to provide the telephone number to consumers with passbook accounts that can only be accessed by preauthorized credits and that do not receive periodic statements. For example, it may print the telephone number in the passbook, or include the number with the annual error resolution notice.\r\n\r\n{10-a-1-Interp-7}\r\n7. *Telephone line availability.* To satisfy the readily-available standard, the financial institution must provide enough telephone lines so that consumers get a reasonably prompt response. The institution need only provide telephone service during normal business hours. Within its primary service area, an institution must provide a local or toll-free telephone number. It need not provide a toll-free number or accept collect long-distance calls from outside the area where it normally conducts business.\r\n\r\n{10-b-Interp}\r\n#### 10(b) Written Authorization for Preauthorized Transfers From Consumer's Account\r\n\r\n{10-b-Interp-1}\r\n1. *Preexisting authorizations.* The financial institution need not require a new authorization before changing from paper-based to electronic debiting when the existing authorization does not specify that debiting is to occur electronically or specifies that the debiting will occur by paper means. A new authorization also is not required when a successor institution begins collecting payments.\r\n\r\n{10-b-Interp-2}\r\n2. *Authorization obtained by third party.* The account-holding financial institution does not violate the regulation when a third-party payee fails to obtain the authorization in writing or fails to give a copy to the consumer; rather, it is the third-party payee that is in violation of the regulation.\r\n\r\n{10-b-Interp-3}\r\n3. *Written authorization for preauthorized transfers.* The requirement that preauthorized EFTs be authorized by the consumer \u201conly by a writing\u201d cannot be met by a payee's signing a written authorization on the consumer's behalf with only an oral authorization from the consumer.\r\n\r\n{10-b-Interp-4}\r\n4. *Use of a confirmation form.* A financial institution or designated payee may comply with the requirements of this section in various ways. For example, a payee may provide the consumer with two copies of a preauthorization form, and ask the consumer to sign and return one and to retain the second copy.\r\n\r\n{10-b-Interp-5}\r\n5. *Similarly authenticated.* The similarly authenticated standard permits signed, written authorizations to be provided electronically. The writing and signature requirements of this section are satisfied by complying with the Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act, 15 U.S.C. 7001 *et seq.,* which defines electronic records and electronic signatures. Examples of electronic signatures include, but are not limited to, digital signatures and security codes. A security code need not originate with the account-holding institution. The authorization process should evidence the consumer's identity and assent to the authorization. The person that obtains the authorization must provide a copy of the terms of the authorization to the consumer either electronically or in paper form. Only the consumer may authorize the transfer and not, for example, a third-party merchant on behalf of the consumer.\r\n\r\n{10-b-Interp-6}\r\n6. *Requirements of an authorization.* An authorization is valid if it is readily identifiable as such and the terms of the preauthorized transfer are clear and readily understandable.\r\n\r\n{10-b-Interp-7}\r\n7. *Bona fide error.* Consumers sometimes authorize third-party payees, by telephone or online, to submit recurring charges against a credit card account. If the consumer indicates use of a credit card account when in fact a debit card is being used, the payee does not violate the requirement to obtain a written authorization if the failure to obtain written authorization was not intentional and resulted from a bona fide error, and if the payee maintains procedures reasonably adapted to avoid any such error. Procedures reasonably adapted to avoid error will depend upon the circumstances. Generally, requesting the consumer to specify whether the card to be used for the authorization is a debit (or check) card or a credit card is a reasonable procedure. Where the consumer has indicated that the card is a credit card (or that the card is not a debit or check card), the payee may rely on the consumer's statement without seeking further information about the type of card. If the payee believes, at the time of the authorization, that a credit card is involved, and later finds that the card used is a debit card (for example, because the consumer later brings the matter to the payee's attention), the payee must obtain a written and signed or (where appropriate) a similarly authenticated authorization as soon as reasonably possible, or cease debiting the consumer's account.\r\n\r\n{10-c-Interp}\r\n#### 10(c) Consumer's Right to Stop Payment\r\n\r\n{10-c-Interp-1}\r\n1. *Stop-payment order.* The financial institution must honor an oral stop-payment order made at least three business days before a scheduled debit. If the debit item is resubmitted, the institution must continue to honor the stop-payment order (for example, by suspending all subsequent payments to the payee-originator until the consumer notifies the institution that payments should resume).\r\n\r\n{10-c-Interp-2}\r\n2. *Revocation of authorization.* Once a financial institution has been notified that the consumer's authorization is no longer valid, it must block all future payments for the particular debit transmitted by the designated payee-originator. *But see* comment 10(c)-3. The institution may not wait for the payee-originator to terminate the automatic debits. The institution may confirm that the consumer has informed the payee-originator of the revocation (for example, by requiring a copy of the consumer's revocation as written confirmation to be provided within 14 days of an oral notification). If the institution does not receive the required written confirmation within the 14-day period, it may honor subsequent debits to the account.\r\n\r\n{10-c-Interp-3}\r\n3. *Alternative procedure for processing a stop-payment request.* If an institution does not have the capability to block a preauthorized debit from being posted to the consumer's account - as in the case of a preauthorized debit made through a debit card network or other system, for example - the institution may instead comply with the stop-payment requirements by using a third party to block the transfer(s), as long as the consumer's account is not debited for the payment.\r\n\r\n{10-d-Interp}\r\n#### 10(d) Notice of Transfers Varying in Amount\r\n\r\n{10-d-1-Interp}\r\n#### 10(d)(1) Notice\r\n\r\n{10-d-1-Interp-1}\r\n1. *Preexisting authorizations.* A financial institution holding the consumer's account does not violate the regulation if the designated payee fails to provide notice of varying amounts.\r\n\r\n{10-d-2-Interp}\r\n#### 10(d)(2) Range\r\n\r\n{10-d-2-Interp-1}\r\n1. *Range.* A financial institution or designated payee that elects to offer the consumer a specified range of amounts for debiting (in lieu of providing the notice of transfers varying in amount) must provide an acceptable range that could be anticipated by the consumer. For example, if the transfer is for payment of a gas bill, an appropriate range might be based on the highest bill in winter and the lowest bill in summer.\r\n\r\n{10-d-2-Interp-2}\r\n2. *Transfers to an account of the consumer held at another institution.* A financial institution need not provide a consumer the option of receiving notice with each varying transfer, and may instead provide notice only when a debit to an account of the consumer falls outside a specified range or differs by more than a specified amount from the most recent transfer, if the funds are transferred and credited to an account of the consumer held at another financial institution. The specified range or amount, however, must be one that reasonably could be anticipated by the consumer, and the institution must notify the consumer of the range or amount at the time the consumer provides authorization for the preauthorized transfers. For example, if the transfer is for payment of interest for a fixed-rate certificate of deposit account, an appropriate range might be based on a month containing 28 days and a month containing 31 days.\r\n\r\n{10-e-Interp}\r\n#### 10(e) Compulsory Use\r\n\r\n{10-e-1-Interp}\r\n#### 10(e)(1) Credit\r\n\r\n{10-e-1-Interp-1}\r\n1. *Loan payments.* Creditors may not require repayment of loans by electronic means on a preauthorized, recurring basis. A creditor may offer a program with a reduced annual percentage rate or other cost-related incentive for an automatic repayment feature, provided the program with the automatic payment feature is not the only loan program offered by the creditor for the type of credit involved. Examples include:\r\n\r\n{10-e-1-Interp-1-i}\r\ni. Mortgages with graduated payments in which a pledged savings account is automatically debited during an initial period to supplement the monthly payments made by the borrower.\r\n\r\n{10-e-1-Interp-1-ii}\r\nii. Mortgage plans calling for preauthorized biweekly payments that are debited electronically to the consumer's account and produce a lower total finance charge.\r\n\r\n{10-e-1-Interp-2}\r\n2. *Overdraft.* A financial institution may require the automatic repayment of an overdraft credit plan even if the overdraft extension is charged to an open-end account that may be accessed by the consumer in ways other than by overdrafts.\r\n\r\n{10-e-2-Interp}\r\n#### 10(e)(2) Employment or Government Benefit\r\n\r\n{0-e-2-Interp-1}\r\n1. *Payroll.* An employer (including a financial institution) may not require its employees to receive their salary by direct deposit to any particular institution. An employer may require direct deposit of salary by electronic means if employees are allowed to choose the institution that will receive the direct deposit. Alternatively, an employer may give employees the choice of having their salary deposited at a particular institution (designated by the employer) or receiving their salary by another means, such as by check or cash.\r\n\r\n",

        "contents": "{11-Interp}\r\n### Section 1005.11 Procedures for Resolving Errors\r\n\r\n{11-a-Interp}\r\n#### 11(a) Definition of Error\r\n\r\n{11-a-Interp-1}\r\n1. *Terminal location.* With regard to deposits at an ATM, a consumer's request for the terminal location or other information triggers the error resolution procedures, but the financial institution need only provide the ATM location if it has captured that information.\r\n\r\n{11-a-Interp-2}\r\n2. *Verifying an account debit or credit.* If the consumer contacts the financial institution to ascertain whether a payment (for example, in a home-banking or bill-payment program) or any other type of EFT was debited to the account, or whether a deposit made via ATM, preauthorized transfer, or any other type of EFT was credited to the account, without asserting an error, the error resolution procedures do not apply.\r\n\r\n{11-a-Interp-3}\r\n3. *Loss or theft of access device.* A financial institution is required to comply with the error resolution procedures when a consumer reports the loss or theft of an access device if the consumer also alleges possible unauthorized use as a consequence of the loss or theft.\r\n\r\n{11-a-Interp-4}\r\n4. *Error asserted after account closed.* The financial institution must comply with the error resolution procedures when a consumer properly asserts an error, even if the account has been closed.\r\n\r\n{11-a-Interp-5}\r\n5. *Request for documentation or information.* A request for documentation or other information must be treated as an error unless it is clear that the consumer is requesting a duplicate copy for tax or other record-keeping purposes.\r\n\r\n{11-a-Interp-6}\r\n6. *Terminal receipts for transfers of $15 or less.* The fact that an institution does not make a terminal receipt available for a transfer of $15 or less in accordance with \u00a7 1005.9(e) is not an error for purposes of \u00a7 1005.11(a)(1)(vi) or (vii).\r\n\r\n{11-b-Interp}\r\n#### 11(b) Notice of Error From Consumer\r\n\r\n{11-b-1-Interp}\r\n#### 11(b)(1) Timing; Contents\r\n\r\n{11-b-1-Interp-1}\r\n1. *Content of error notice.* The notice of error is effective even if it does not contain the consumer's account number, so long as the financial institution is able to identify the account in question. For example, the consumer could provide a Social Security number or other unique means of identification.\r\n\r\n{11-b-1-Interp-2}\r\n2. *Investigation pending receipt of information.* While a financial institution may request a written, signed statement from the consumer relating to a notice of error, it may not delay initiating or completing an investigation pending receipt of the statement.\r\n\r\n{11-b-1-Interp-3}\r\n3. *Statement held for consumer.* When a consumer has arranged for periodic statements to be held until picked up, the statement for a particular cycle is deemed to have been transmitted on the date the financial institution first makes the statement available to the consumer.\r\n\r\n{11-b-1-Interp-4}\r\n4. *Failure to provide statement.* When a financial institution fails to provide the consumer with a periodic statement, a request for a copy is governed by this section if the consumer gives notice within 60 days from the date on which the statement should have been transmitted.\r\n\r\n{11-b-1-Interp-5}\r\n5. *Discovery of error by institution.* The error resolution procedures of this section apply when a notice of error is received from the consumer, and not when the financial institution itself discovers and corrects an error.\r\n\r\n{11-b-1-Interp-6}\r\n6. *Notice at particular phone number or address.* A financial institution may require the consumer to give notice only at the telephone number or address disclosed by the institution, provided the institution maintains reasonable procedures to refer the consumer to the specified telephone number or address if the consumer attempts to give notice to the institution in a different manner.\r\n\r\n{11-b-1-Interp-7}\r\n7. *Effect of late notice.* An institution is not required to comply with the requirements of this section for any notice of error from the consumer that is received by the institution later than 60 days from the date on which the periodic statement first reflecting the error is sent. Where the consumer's assertion of error involves an unauthorized EFT, however, the institution must comply with \u00a7 1005.6 before it may impose any liability on the consumer.\r\n\r\n{11-b-2-Interp}\r\n#### 11(b)(2) Written Confirmation\r\n\r\n{11-b-2-Interp-1}\r\n1. *Written confirmation-of-error notice.* If the consumer sends a written confirmation of error to the wrong address, the financial institution must process the confirmation through normal procedures. But the institution need not provisionally credit the consumer's account if the written confirmation is delayed beyond 10 business days in getting to the right place because it was sent to the wrong address.\r\n\r\n{11-c-Interp}\r\n#### 11(c) Time Limits and Extent of Investigation\r\n\r\n{11-c-Interp-1}\r\n1. *Notice to consumer.* Unless otherwise indicated in this section, the financial institution may provide the required notices to the consumer either orally or in writing.\r\n\r\n{11-c-Interp-2}\r\n2. *Written confirmation of oral notice.* A financial institution must begin its investigation promptly upon receipt of an oral notice. It may not delay until it has received a written confirmation.\r\n\r\n{11-c-Interp-3}\r\n3. *Charges for error resolution.* If a billing error occurred, whether as alleged or in a different amount or manner, the financial institution may not impose a charge related to any aspect of the error-resolution process (including charges for documentation or investigation). Since the Act grants the consumer error-resolution rights, the institution should avoid any chilling effect on the good-faith assertion of errors that might result if charges are assessed when no billing error has occurred.\r\n\r\n{11-c-Interp-4}\r\n4. *Correction without investigation.* A financial institution may make, without investigation, a final correction to a consumer's account in the amount or manner alleged by the consumer to be in error, but must comply with all other applicable requirements of \u00a7 1005.11.\r\n\r\n{11-c-Interp-5}\r\n5. *Correction notice.* A financial institution may include the notice of correction on a periodic statement that is mailed or delivered within the 10-business-day or 45-calendar-day time limits and that clearly identifies the correction to the consumer's account. The institution must determine whether such a mailing will be prompt enough to satisfy the requirements of this section, taking into account the specific facts involved.\r\n\r\n{11-c-Interp-6}\r\n6. *Correction of an error.* If the financial institution determines an error occurred, within either the 10-day or 45-day period, it must correct the error (subject to the liability provisions of \u00a7\u00a7 1005.6(a) and (b)) including, where applicable, the crediting of interest and the refunding of any fees imposed by the institution. In a combined credit/EFT transaction, for example, the institution must refund any finance charges incurred as a result of the error. The institution need not refund fees that would have been imposed whether or not the error occurred.\r\n\r\n{11-c-Interp-7}\r\n7. *Extent of required investigation.* A financial institution complies with its duty to investigate, correct, and report its determination regarding an error described in \u00a7 1005.11(a)(1)(vii) by transmitting the requested information, clarification, or documentation within the time limits set forth in \u00a7 1005.11(c). If the institution has provisionally credited the consumer's account in accordance with \u00a7 1005.11(c)(2), it may debit the amount upon transmitting the requested information, clarification, or documentation.\r\n\r\n{11-c-2-i-Interp}\r\n#### Paragraph 11(c)(2)(i)\r\n\r\n{11-c-2-i-Interp-1}\r\n1. *Compliance with all requirements.* Financial institutions exempted from provisionally crediting a consumer's account under \u00a7\u00a7 1005.11(c)(2)(i)(A) and (B) must still comply with all other requirements of \u00a7 1005.11.\r\n\r\n{11-c-3-Interp}\r\n#### 11(c)(3) Extension of Time Periods\r\n\r\n{11-c-3-Interp-1}\r\n1. *POS debit card transactions.* The extended deadlines for investigating errors resulting from POS debit card transactions apply to all debit card transactions, including those for cash only, at merchants' POS terminals, and also including mail and telephone orders. The deadlines do not apply to transactions at an ATM, however, even though the ATM may be in a merchant location.\r\n\r\n{11-c-4-Interp}\r\n#### 11(c)(4) Investigation\r\n\r\n{11-c-4-Interp-1}\r\n1. *Third parties.* When information or documentation requested by the consumer is in the possession of a third party with whom the financial institution does not have an agreement, the institution satisfies the error resolution requirement by so advising the consumer within the specified time period.\r\n\r\n{11-c-4-Interp-2}\r\n2. *Scope of investigation.* When an alleged error involves a payment to a third party under the financial institution's telephone bill-payment plan, a review of the institution's own records is sufficient, assuming no agreement exists between the institution and the third party concerning the bill-payment service.\r\n\r\n{11-c-4-Interp-3}\r\n3. *POS transfers.* When a consumer alleges an error involving a transfer to a merchant via a POS terminal, the institution must verify the information previously transmitted when executing the transfer. For example, the financial institution may request a copy of the sales receipt to verify that the amount of the transfer correctly corresponds to the amount of the consumer's purchase.\r\n\r\n{11-c-4-Interp-4}\r\n4. *Agreement.* An agreement that a third party will honor an access device is an agreement for purposes of this paragraph. A financial institution does not have an agreement for purposes of \u00a7 1005.11(c)(4)(ii) solely because it participates in transactions that occur under the Federal recurring payments programs, or that are cleared through an ACH or similar arrangement for the clearing and settlement of fund transfers generally, or because the institution agrees to be bound by the rules of such an arrangement.\r\n\r\n{11-c-4-Interp-5}\r\n5. *No EFT agreement.* When there is no agreement between the institution and the third party for the type of EFT involved, the financial institution must review any relevant information within the institution's own records for the particular account to resolve the consumer's claim. The extent of the investigation required may vary depending on the facts and circumstances. However, a financial institution may not limit its investigation solely to the payment instructions where additional information within its own records pertaining to the particular account in question could help to resolve a consumer's claim. Information that may be reviewed as part of an investigation might include:\r\n\r\n{11-c-4-Interp-5-i}\r\ni. The ACH transaction records for the transfer;\r\n\r\n{11-c-4-Interp-5-ii}\r\nii. The transaction history of the particular account for a reasonable period of time immediately preceding the allegation of error;\r\n\r\n{11-c-4-Interp-5-iii}\r\niii. Whether the check number of the transaction in question is notably out-of-sequence;\r\n\r\n{11-c-4-Interp-5-iv}\r\niv. The location of either the transaction or the payee in question relative to the consumer's place of residence and habitual transaction area;\r\n\r\n{11-c-4-Interp-5-v}\r\nv. Information relative to the account in question within the control of the institution's third-party service providers if the financial institution reasonably believes that it may have records or other information that could be dispositive; or\r\n\r\n{11-c-4-Interp-5-vi}\r\nvi. Any other information appropriate to resolve the claim.\r\n\r\n{11-d-Interp}\r\n#### 11(d) Procedures if Financial Institution Determines No Error or Different Error Occurred\r\n\r\n{11-d-Interp-1}\r\n1. *Error different from that alleged.* When a financial institution determines that an error occurred in a manner or amount different from that described by the consumer, it must comply with the requirements of both \u00a7\u00a7 1005.11(c) and (d), as relevant. The institution may give the notice of correction and the explanation separately or in a combined form.\r\n\r\n{11-d-1-Interp}\r\n#### 11(d)(1) Written Explanation\r\n\r\n{11-d-1-Interp-1}\r\n1. *Request for documentation.* When a consumer requests copies of documents, the financial institution must provide the copies in an understandable form. If an institution relied on magnetic tape, it must convert the applicable data into readable form, for example, by printing it and explaining any codes.\r\n\r\n{11-d-2-Interp}\r\n#### 11(d)(2) Debiting Provisional Credit\r\n\r\n{11-d-2-Interp-1}\r\n1. *Alternative procedure for debiting of credited funds.* The financial institution may comply with the requirements of this section by notifying the consumer that the consumer's account will be debited five business days from the transmittal of the notification, specifying the calendar date on which the debiting will occur.\r\n\r\n{11-d-2-Interp-2}\r\n2. *Fees for overdrafts.* The financial institution may not impose fees for items it is required to honor under \u00a7 1005.11. It may, however, impose any normal transaction or item fee that is unrelated to an overdraft resulting from the debiting. If the account is still overdrawn after five business days, the institution may impose the fees or finance charges to which it is entitled, if any, under an overdraft credit plan.\r\n\r\n{11-e-Interp}\r\n#### 11(e) Reassertion of Error\r\n\r\n{11-e-Interp-1}\r\n1. *Withdrawal of error; right to reassert.* The financial institution has no further error resolution responsibilities if the consumer voluntarily withdraws the notice alleging an error. A consumer who has withdrawn an allegation of error has the right to reassert the allegation unless the financial institution had already complied with all of the error resolution requirements before the allegation was withdrawn. The consumer must do so, however, within the original 60-day period.\r\n",

For transactions involving access devices that also function as credit cards, whether Regulation E or Regulation Z (12 CFR part 1026) applies depends on the nature of the transaction. For example, if the transaction solely involves an extension of credit, and does not include a debit to a checking account (or other consumer asset account), the liability limitations and error resolution requirements of Regulation Z apply. If the transaction debits a checking account only (with no credit extended), the provisions of Regulation E apply. If the transaction debits a checking account but also draws on an overdraft line of credit attached to the account, Regulation E's liability limitations apply, in addition to \u00a7\u00a7 1026.13(d) and (g) of Regulation Z (which apply because of the extension of credit associated with the overdraft feature on the checking account). If a consumer's access device is also a credit card and the device is used to make unauthorized withdrawals from a checking account, but also is used to obtain unauthorized cash advances directly from a line of credit that is separate from the checking account, both Regulation E and Regulation Z apply.\r\n\r\n{2-a-Interp-1-ii}\r\nii. The following examples illustrate these principles:\r\n\r\n{2-a-Interp-1-ii-A}\r\nA. A consumer has a card that can be used either as a credit card or a debit card. When used as a debit card, the card draws on the consumer's checking account. When used as a credit card, the card draws only on a separate line of credit. If the card is stolen and used as a credit card to make purchases or to get cash advances at an ATM from the line of credit, the liability limits and error resolution provisions of Regulation Z apply; Regulation E does not apply.\r\n\r\n{2-a-Interp-1-ii-B}\r\nB. In the same situation, if the card is stolen and is used as a debit card to make purchases or to get cash withdrawals at an ATM from the checking account, the liability limits and error resolution provisions of Regulation E apply; Regulation Z does not apply.\r\n\r\n{2-a-Interp-1-ii-C}\r\nC. In the same situation, assume the card is stolen and used both as a debit card and as a credit card; for example, the thief makes some purchases using the card as a debit card, and other purchases using the card as a credit card. Here, the liability limits and error resolution provisions of Regulation E apply to the unauthorized transactions in which the card was used as a debit card, and the corresponding provisions of Regulation Z apply to the unauthorized transactions in which the card was used as a credit card.\r\n\r\n{2-a-Interp-1-ii-D}\r\nD. Assume a somewhat different type of card, one that draws on the consumer's checking account and can also draw on an overdraft line of credit attached to the checking account. There is no separate line of credit, only the overdraft line, associated with the card. In this situation, if the card is stolen and used, the liability limits and the error resolution provisions of Regulation E apply. In addition, if the use of the card has resulted in accessing the overdraft line of credit, the error resolution provisions of \u00a7\u00a7 1026.13(d) and (g) of Regulation Z also apply, but not the other error resolution provisions of Regulation Z.\r\n\r\n{2-a-Interp-2}\r\n2. *Issuance rules.* For access devices that also constitute credit cards, the issuance rules of Regulation E apply if the only credit feature is a preexisting credit line attached to the asset account to cover overdrafts (or to maintain a specified minimum balance) or an overdraft service, as defined in \u00a7 1005.17(a). Regulation Z (12 CFR part 1026) rules apply if there is another type of credit feature; for example, one permitting direct extensions of credit that do not involve the asset account.\r\n\r\n{2-a-Interp-3}\r\n3. *Overdraft service.* The addition of an overdraft service, as that term is defined in \u00a7 1005.17(a), to an accepted access device does not constitute the addition of a credit feature subject to Regulation Z. Instead, the provisions of Regulation E apply, including the liability limitations (\u00a7 1005.6) and the requirement to obtain consumer consent to the service before any fees or charges for paying an overdraft may be assessed on the account (\u00a7 1005.17).\r\n\r\n{12-b-Interp}\r\n#### 12(b) Preemption of Inconsistent State Laws\r\n\r\n{12-b-Interp-1}\r\n1. *Specific determinations.* The regulation prescribes standards for determining whether state laws that govern EFTs, and state laws regarding gift certificates, store gift cards, or general-use prepaid cards that govern dormancy, inactivity, or service fees, or expiration dates, are preempted by the Act and the regulation. A state law that is inconsistent may be preempted even if the Bureau has not issued a determination. However, nothing in \u00a7 1005.12(b) provides a financial institution with immunity for violations of state law if the institution chooses not to make state disclosures and the Bureau later determines that the state law is not preempted.\r\n\r\n{12-b-Interp-2}\r\n2. *Preemption determination.* The Bureau recognizes state law preemption determinations made by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System prior to July 21, 2011, until and unless the Bureau makes and publishes any contrary determination. The Board of Governors determined that certain provisions in the state law of Michigan are preempted by the Federal law, effective March 30, 1981:\r\n\r\n{12-b-Interp-2-i}\r\ni. Definition of unauthorized use. Section 5(4) is preempted to the extent that it relates to the section of state law governing consumer liability for unauthorized use of an access device.\r\n\r\n{12-b-Interp-2-ii}\r\nii. Consumer liability for unauthorized use of an account. Section 14 is inconsistent with \u00a7 1005.6 and is less protective of the consumer than the Federal law. The state law places liability on the consumer for the unauthorized use of an account in cases involving the consumer's negligence. Under the Federal law, a consumer's liability for unauthorized use is not related to the consumer's negligence and depends instead on the consumer's promptness in reporting the loss or theft of the access device.\r\n\r\n{12-b-Interp-2-iii}\r\niii. Error resolution. Section 15 is preempted because it is inconsistent with \u00a7 1005.11 and is less protective of the consumer than the Federal law. The state law allows financial institutions up to 70 days to resolve errors, whereas the Federal law generally requires errors to be resolved within 45 days.\r\n\r\n{12-b-Interp-2-iv}\r\niv. Receipts and periodic statements. Sections 17 and 18 are preempted because they are inconsistent with \u00a7 1005.9. The state provisions require a different disclosure of information than does the Federal law. The receipt provision is also preempted because it allows the consumer to be charged for receiving a receipt if a machine cannot furnish one at the time of a transfer.\r\n\r\n",

If the service provider does not issue an access device to the consumer for accessing an account held by another institution, it does not qualify for the treatment accorded by \u00a7 1005.14. For example, this section does not apply to an institution that initiates preauthorized payroll deposits to consumer accounts on behalf of an employer. By contrast, \u00a7 1005.14 can apply to an institution that issues a code for initiating telephone transfers to be carried out through the ACH from a consumer's account at another institution. This is the case even if the consumer has accounts at both institutions.\r\n\r\n{14-a-Interp-2}\r\n2. *ACH agreements.* The ACH rules generally do not constitute an agreement for purposes of this section. However, an ACH agreement under which members specifically agree to honor each other's debit cards is an \u201cagreement,\u201d and thus this section does not apply.\r\n\r\n{14-b-Interp}\r\n#### 14(b) Compliance by Electronic Fund Transfer Service Provider\r\n\r\n{14-b-Interp-1}\r\n1. *Liability.* The service provider is liable for unauthorized EFTs that exceed limits on the consumer's liability under \u00a7 1005.6.\r\n\r\n{14-b-1-Interp}\r\n#### 14(b)(1) Disclosures and Documentation\r\n\r\n{14-b-1-Interp-1}\r\n1. *Periodic statements from electronic fund transfer service provider.* A service provider that meets the conditions set forth in this paragraph does not have to issue periodic statements. A service provider that does not meet the conditions need only include on periodic statements information about transfers initiated with the access device it has issued.\r\n\r\n{14-b-2-Interp}\r\n#### 14(b)(2) Error Resolution\r\n\r\n{14-b-2-Interp-1}\r\n1. *Error resolution.* When a consumer notifies the service provider of an error, the EFT service provider must investigate and resolve the error in compliance with \u00a7 1005.11 as modified by \u00a7 1005.14(b)(2). If an error occurred, any fees or charges imposed as a result of the error, either by the service provider or by the account-holding institution (for example, overdraft or dishonor fees) must be reimbursed to the consumer by the service provider.\r\n\r\n{14-c-Interp}\r\n#### 14(c) Compliance by Account-Holding Institution\r\n\r\n{14-c-1-Interp}\r\n#### 14(c)(1) Documentation\r\n\r\n{14-c-1-Interp-1}\r\n1. *Periodic statements from account-holding institution.* The periodic statement provided by the account-holding institution need only contain the information required by \u00a7 1005.9(b)(1).\r\n\r\n",

        "subpart": 7,
        "contents": "{17-Interp}\r\n### Section 1005.17 Requirements for Overdraft Services\r\n\r\n{17-a-Interp}\r\n#### 17(a) Definition\r\n\r\n{17-a-Interp-1}\r\n1. *Exempt securities- and commodities-related lines of credit.* The definition of \u201coverdraft service\u201d does not include the payment of transactions in a securities or commodities account pursuant to which credit is extended by a broker-dealer registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission or the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.\r\n\r\n{17-b-Interp}\r\n#### 17(b) Opt-In Requirement\r\n\r\n{17-b-Interp-1}\r\n1. *Scope.*\r\n\r\n{17-b-Interp-1-i}\r\ni. *Account-holding institutions.* Section 1005.17(b) applies to ATM and one-time debit card transactions made with a debit card issued by or on behalf of the account-holding institution. Section 1005.17(b) does not apply to ATM and one-time debit card transactions made with a debit card issued by or through a third party unless the debit card is issued on behalf of the account-holding institution.\r\n\r\n{17-b-Interp-1-ii}\r\nii. *Coding of transactions.* A financial institution complies with the rule if it adapts its systems to identify debit card transactions as either one-time or recurring. If it does so, the financial institution may rely on the transaction's coding by merchants, other institutions, and other third parties as a one-time or a preauthorized or recurring debit card transaction.\r\n\r\n{17-b-Interp-1-iii}\r\niii. *One-time debit card transactions.* The opt-in applies to any one-time debit card transaction, whether the card is used, for example, at a point-of-sale, in an online transaction, or in a telephone transaction.\r\n\r\n{17-b-Interp-1-iv}\r\niv. *Application of fee prohibition.* The prohibition on assessing overdraft fees under \u00a7 1005.17(b)(1) applies to all institutions. For example, the prohibition applies to an institution that has a policy and practice of declining to authorize and pay any ATM or one-time debit card transactions when the institution has a reasonable belief at the time of the authorization request that the consumer does not have sufficient funds available to cover the transaction. However, the institution is not required to comply with \u00a7\u00a7 1005.17(b)(1)(i)-(iv), including the notice and opt-in requirements, if it does not assess overdraft fees for paying ATM or one-time debit card transactions that overdraw the consumer's account. Assume an institution does not provide an opt-in notice, but authorizes an ATM or one-time debit card transaction on the reasonable belief that the consumer has sufficient funds in the account to cover the transaction. If, at settlement, the consumer has insufficient funds in the account (for example, due to intervening transactions that post to the consumer's account), the institution is not permitted to assess an overdraft fee or charge for paying that transaction.\r\n\r\n{17-b-Interp-2}\r\n2. *No affirmative consent.* A financial institution may pay overdrafts for ATM and one-time debit card transactions even if a consumer has not affirmatively consented or opted in to the institution's overdraft service. If the institution pays such an overdraft without the consumer's affirmative consent, however, it may not impose a fee or charge for doing so. These provisions do not limit the institution's ability to debit the consumer's account for the amount overdrawn if the institution is permitted to do so under applicable law.\r\n\r\n{17-b-Interp-3}\r\n3. *Overdraft transactions not required to be authorized or paid.* Section 1005.17 does not require a financial institution to authorize or pay an overdraft on an ATM or one-time debit card transaction even if the consumer has affirmatively consented to an institution's overdraft service for such transactions.\r\n\r\n{17-b-Interp-4}\r\n4. *Reasonable opportunity to provide affirmative consent.* A financial institution provides a consumer with a reasonable opportunity to provide affirmative consent when, among other things, it provides reasonable methods by which the consumer may affirmatively consent. A financial institution provides such reasonable methods, if:\r\n\r\n{17-b-Interp-4-i}\r\ni. *By mail.* The institution provides a form for the consumer to fill out and mail to affirmatively consent to the service.\r\n\r\n{17-b-Interp-4-ii}\r\nii. *By telephone.* The institution provides a readily-available telephone line that consumers may call to provide affirmative consent.\r\n\r\n{17-b-Interp-4-iii}\r\niii. *By electronic means.* The institution provides an electronic means for the consumer to affirmatively consent. For example, the institution could provide a form that can be accessed and processed at its Web site, where the consumer may click on a check box to provide consent and confirm that choice by clicking on a button that affirms the consumer's consent.\r\n\r\n{17-b-Interp-4-iv}\r\niv. *In person.* The institution provides a form for the consumer to complete and present at a branch or office to affirmatively consent to the service.\r\n\r\n{17-b-Interp-5}\r\n5. *Implementing opt-in at account-opening.* A financial institution may provide notice regarding the institution's overdraft service prior to or at account-opening. A financial institution may require a consumer, as a necessary step to opening an account, to choose whether or not to opt into the payment of ATM or one-time debit card transactions pursuant to the institution's overdraft service. For example, the institution could require the consumer, at account opening, to sign a signature line or check a box on a form (consistent with comment 17(b)-6) indicating whether or not the consumer affirmatively consents at account opening. If the consumer does not check any box or provide a signature, the institution must assume that the consumer does not opt in. Or, the institution could require the consumer to choose between an account that does not permit the payment of ATM or one-time debit card transactions pursuant to the institution's overdraft service and an account that permits the payment of such overdrafts, provided that the accounts comply with \u00a7 1005.17(b)(2) and \u00a7 1005.17(b)(3).\r\n\r\n{17-b-Interp-6}\r\n6. *Affirmative consent required.* A consumer's affirmative consent, or opt-in, to a financial institution's overdraft service must be obtained separately from other consents or acknowledgements obtained by the institution, including a consent to receive disclosures electronically. An institution may obtain a consumer's affirmative consent by providing a blank signature line or check box that the consumer could sign or select to affirmatively consent, provided that the signature line or check box is used solely for purposes of evidencing the consumer's choice whether or not to opt into the overdraft service and not for other purposes. An institution does not obtain a consumer's affirmative consent by including preprinted language about the overdraft service in an account disclosure provided with a signature card or contract that the consumer must sign to open the account and that acknowledges the consumer's acceptance of the account terms. Nor does an institution obtain a consumer's affirmative consent by providing a signature card that contains a pre-selected check box indicating that the consumer is requesting the service.\r\n\r\n{17-b-Interp-7}\r\n7. *Confirmation.* A financial institution may comply with the requirement in \u00a7 1005.17(b)(1)(iv) to provide confirmation of the consumer's affirmative consent by mailing or delivering to the consumer a copy of the consumer's completed opt-in notice, or by mailing or delivering a letter or notice to the consumer acknowledging that the consumer has elected to opt into the institution's service. The confirmation, which must be provided in writing, or electronically if the consumer agrees, must include a statement informing the consumer of the right to revoke the opt-in at any time. *See* \u00a7 1005.17(d)(6), which permits institutions to include the revocation statement on the initial opt-in notice. An institution complies with the confirmation requirement if it has adopted reasonable procedures designed to ensure that overdraft fees are assessed only in connection with transactions paid after the confirmation has been mailed or delivered to the consumer.\r\n\r\n{17-b-Interp-8}\r\n8. *Outstanding Negative Balance.* If a fee or charge is based on the amount of the outstanding negative balance, an institution is prohibited from assessing any such fee if the negative balance is solely attributable to an ATM or one-time debit card transaction, unless the consumer has opted into the institution's overdraft service for ATM or one-time debit card transactions. However, the rule does not prohibit an institution from assessing such a fee if the negative balance is attributable in whole or in part to a check, ACH, or other type of transaction not subject to the prohibition on assessing overdraft fees in \u00a7 1005.17(b)(1).\r\n\r\n{17-b-Interp-9}\r\n9. *Daily or Sustained Overdraft, Negative Balance, or Similar Fee or Charge*\r\n\r\n{17-b-Interp-9-i}\r\ni. *Daily or sustained overdraft, negative balance, or similar fees or charges.* If a consumer has not opted into the institution's overdraft service for ATM or one-time debit card transactions, the fee prohibition in \u00a7 1005.17(b)(1) applies to all overdraft fees or charges for paying those transactions, including but not limited to daily or sustained overdraft, negative balance, or similar fees or charges. Thus, where a consumer's negative balance is solely attributable to an ATM or one-time debit card transaction, the rule prohibits the assessment of such fees unless the consumer has opted in. However, the rule does not prohibit an institution from assessing daily or sustained overdraft, negative balance, or similar fees or charges if a negative balance is attributable in whole or in part to a check, ACH, or other type of transaction not subject to the fee prohibition. When the negative balance is attributable in part to an ATM or one-time debit card transaction, and in part to a check, ACH, or other type of transaction not subject to the fee prohibition, the date on which such a fee may be assessed is based on the date on which the check, ACH, or other type of transaction is paid into overdraft.\r\n\r\n{17-b-Interp-9-ii}\r\nii. *Examples.* The following examples illustrate how an institution complies with the fee prohibition. For each example, assume the following: (a) The consumer has not opted into the payment of ATM or one-time debit card overdrafts; (b) these transactions are paid into overdraft because the amount of the transaction at settlement exceeded the amount authorized or the amount was not submitted for authorization; (c) under the account agreement, the institution may charge a per-item fee of $20 for each overdraft, and a one-time sustained overdraft fee of $20 on the fifth consecutive day the consumer's account remains overdrawn; (d) the institution posts ATM and debit card transactions before other transactions; and (e) the institution allocates deposits to account debits in the same order in which it posts debits.\r\n\r\n{17-b-Interp-9-ii-A}\r\nA. Assume that a consumer has a $50 account balance on March 1. That day, the institution posts a one-time debit card transaction of $60 and a check transaction of $40. The institution charges an overdraft fee of $20 for the check overdraft but cannot assess an overdraft fee for the debit card transaction. At the end of the day, the consumer has an account balance of negative $70. The consumer does not make any deposits to the account, and no other transactions occur between March 2 and March 6. Because the consumer's negative balance is attributable in part to the $40 check (and associated overdraft fee), the institution may charge a sustained overdraft fee on March 6 in connection with the check.\r\n\r\n{17-b-Interp-9-ii-B}\r\nB. Same facts as in A., except that on March 3, the consumer deposits $40 in the account. The institution allocates the $40 to the debit card transaction first, consistent with its posting order policy. At the end of the day on March 3, the consumer has an account balance of negative $30, which is attributable to the check transaction (and associated overdraft fee). The consumer does not make any further deposits to the account, and no other transactions occur between March 4 and March 6. Because the remaining negative balance is attributable to the March 1 check transaction, the institution may charge a sustained overdraft fee on March 6 in connection with the check.\r\n\r\n{17-b-Interp-9-ii-C}\r\nC. Assume that a consumer has a $50 account balance on March 1. That day, the institution posts a one-time debit card transaction of $60. At the end of that day, the consumer has an account balance of negative $10. The institution may not assess an overdraft fee for the debit card transaction. On March 3, the institution pays a check transaction of $100 and charges an overdraft fee of $20. At the end of that day, the consumer has an account balance of negative $130. The consumer does not make any deposits to the account, and no other transactions occur between March 4 and March 8. Because the consumer's negative balance is attributable in part to the check, the institution may assess a $20 sustained overdraft fee. However, because the check was paid on March 3, the institution must use March 3 as the start date for determining the date on which the sustained overdraft fee may be assessed. Thus, the institution may charge a $20 sustained overdraft fee on March 8.\r\n\r\n{17-b-Interp-9-iii}\r\niii. *Alternative approach.* For a consumer who does not opt into the institution's overdraft service for ATM and one-time debit card transactions, an institution may also comply with the fee prohibition in \u00a7 1005.17(b)(1) by not assessing daily or sustained overdraft, negative balance, or similar fees or charges unless a consumer's negative balance is attributable solely to check, ACH or other types of transactions not subject to the fee prohibition while that negative balance remains outstanding. In such case, the institution would not have to determine how to allocate subsequent deposits that reduce but do not eliminate the negative balance. For example, if a consumer has a negative balance of $30, of which $10 is attributable to a one-time debit card transaction, an institution complies with the fee prohibition if it does not assess a sustained overdraft fee while that negative balance remains outstanding.\r\n\r\n{17-b-2-Interp}\r\n#### 17(b)(2) Conditioning Payment of Other Overdrafts on Consumer's Affirmative Consent\r\n\r\n{17-b-2-Interp-1}\r\n1. *Application of the same criteria.* The prohibitions on conditioning in \u00a7 1005.17(b)(2) generally require an institution to apply the same criteria for deciding when to pay overdrafts for checks, ACH transactions, and other types of transactions, whether or not the consumer has affirmatively consented to the institution's overdraft service with respect to ATM and one-time debit card overdrafts. For example, if an institution's internal criteria would lead the institution to pay a check overdraft if the consumer had affirmatively consented to the institution's overdraft service for ATM and one-time debit card transactions, it must also apply the same criteria in a consistent manner in determining whether to pay the check overdraft if the consumer has not opted in.\r\n\r\n{17-b-2-Interp-2}\r\n2. *No requirement to pay overdrafts on checks, ACH transactions, or other types of transactions.* The prohibition on conditioning in \u00a7 1005.17(b)(2) does not require an institution to pay overdrafts on checks, ACH transactions, or other types of transactions in all circumstances. Rather, the rule simply prohibits institutions from considering the consumer's decision not to opt in when deciding whether to pay overdrafts for checks, ACH transactions, or other types of transactions.2&gt;17(b)(3) Same Account Terms, Conditions, and Features\r\n\r\n\r\n{17-b-3-Interp}\r\n#### 17(b)(3) Same Account Terms, Conditions, and Features\r\n\r\n{17-b-3-Interp-1}\r\n1. *Variations in terms, conditions, or features.* A financial institution may not vary the terms, conditions, or features of an account provided to a consumer who does not affirmatively consent to the payment of ATM or one-time debit card transactions pursuant to the institution's overdraft service. This includes, but is not limited to:\r\n\r\n{17-b-3-Interp-1-i}\r\ni. Interest rates paid and fees assessed;\r\n\r\n{17-b-3-Interp-1-ii}\r\nii. The type of ATM or debit card provided to the consumer. For instance, an institution may not provide consumers who do not opt in a PIN-only card while providing a debit card with both PIN and signature-debit functionality to consumers who opt in;\r\n\r\n{17-b-3-Interp-1-iii}\r\niii. Minimum balance requirements; or\r\n\r\n{17-b-3-Interp-1-iv}\r\niv. Account features such as online bill payment services.\r\n\r\n{17-b-3-Interp-2}\r\n2. *Limited-feature bank accounts.* Section 1005.17(b)(3) does not prohibit institutions from offering deposit account products with limited features, provided that a consumer is not required to open such an account because the consumer did not opt in. For example, \u00a7 1005.17(b)(3) does not prohibit an institution from offering a checking account designed to comply with state basic banking laws, or designed for consumers who are not eligible for a checking account because of their credit or checking account history, which may include features limiting the payment of overdrafts. However, a consumer who applies, and is otherwise eligible, for a full-service or other particular deposit account product may not be provided instead with the account with more limited features because the consumer has declined to opt in.\r\n\r\n{17-c-Interp}\r\n#### 17(c) Timing\r\n\r\n{17-c-Interp-1}\r\n1. *Permitted fees or charges.* Fees or charges for ATM and one-time debit card overdrafts may be assessed only for overdrafts paid on or after the date the financial institution receives the consumer's affirmative consent to the institution's overdraft service. *See also* comment 17(b)-7.\r\n\r\n{17-d-Interp}\r\n#### 17(d) Content and Format\r\n\r\n{17-d-Interp-1}\r\n1. *Overdraft service.* The description of the institution's overdraft service should indicate that the consumer has the right to affirmatively consent, or opt into payment of overdrafts for ATM and one-time debit card transactions. The description should also disclose the institution's policies regarding the payment of overdrafts for other transactions, including checks, ACH transactions, and automatic bill payments, provided that this content is not more prominent than the description of the consumer's right to opt into payment of overdrafts for ATM and one-time debit card transactions. As applicable, the institution also should indicate that it pays overdrafts at its discretion, and should briefly explain that if the institution does not authorize and pay an overdraft, it may decline the transaction.\r\n\r\n{17-d-Interp-2}\r\n2. *Maximum fee.* If the amount of a fee may vary from transaction to transaction, the financial institution may indicate that the consumer may be assessed a fee \u201cup to\u201d the maximum fee. The financial institution must disclose all applicable overdraft fees, including but not limited to:\r\n\r\n{17-d-Interp-2-i}\r\ni. Per item or per transaction fees;\r\n\r\n{17-d-Interp-2-ii}\r\nii. Daily overdraft fees;\r\n\r\n{17-d-Interp-2-iii}\r\niii. Sustained overdraft fees, where fees are assessed when the consumer has not repaid the amount of the overdraft after some period of time (for example, if an account remains overdrawn for five or more business days); or\r\n\r\n{17-d-Interp-2-iv}\r\niv. Negative balance fees.\r\n\r\n{17-d-Interp-3}\r\n3. *Opt-in methods.* The opt-in notice must include the methods by which the consumer may consent to the overdraft service for ATM and one-time debit card transactions. Institutions may tailor Model Form A-9 to the methods offered to consumers for affirmatively consenting to the service. For example, an institution need not provide the tear-off portion of Model Form A-9 if it is only permitting consumers to opt-in telephonically or electronically. Institutions may, but are not required, to provide a signature line or check box where the consumer can indicate that he or she declines to opt in.\r\n\r\n{17-d-Interp-4}\r\n4. *Identification of consumer's account.* An institution may use any reasonable method to identify the account for which the consumer submits the opt-in notice. For example, the institution may include a line for a printed name and an account number, as shown in Model Form A-9. Or, the institution may print a bar code or use other tracking information. *See also* comment 17(b)-6, which describes how an institution obtains a consumer's affirmative consent.\r\n\r\n{17-d-Interp-5}\r\n5. *Alternative plans for covering overdrafts.* If the institution offers both a line of credit subject to Regulation Z (12 CFR part 1026) and a service that transfers funds from another account of the consumer held at the institution to cover overdrafts, the institution must state in its opt-in notice that both alternative plans are offered. For example, the notice might state \u201cWe also offer *overdraft protection plans,* such as a link to a savings account or to an overdraft line of credit, which may be less expensive than our standard overdraft practices.\u201d If the institution offers one, but not the other, it must state in its opt-in notice the alternative plan that it offers. If the institution does not offer either plan, it should omit the reference to the alternative plans.\r\n\r\n{17-f-Interp}\r\n#### 17(f) Continuing Right To Opt-In or To Revoke the Opt-In\r\n\r\n{17-f-Interp-1}\r\n1. *Fees or charges for overdrafts incurred prior to revocation.* Section 1005.17(f)(1) provides that a consumer may revoke his or her prior consent at any time. If a consumer does so, this provision does not require the financial institution to waive or reverse any overdraft fees assessed on the consumer's account prior to the institution's implementation of the consumer's revocation request.\r\n\r\n{17-g-Interp}\r\n#### 17(g) Duration of Opt-In\r\n\r\n{17-g-Interp-1}\r\n1. *Termination of overdraft service.* A financial institution may, for example, terminate the overdraft service when the consumer makes excessive use of the service.\r\n",

        "contents": "{18-Interp}\r\n### Section 1005.18 Requirements for Financial Institutions Offering Payroll Card Accounts\r\n\r\n{18-a-Interp}\r\n#### 18(a) Coverage\r\n\r\n{18-a-Interp-1}\r\n1. *Issuance of access device.* Consistent with \u00a7 1005.5(a), a financial institution may issue an access device only in response to an oral or written request for the device, or as a renewal or substitute for an accepted access device. A consumer is deemed to request an access device for a payroll card account when the consumer chooses to receive salary or other compensation through a payroll card account.\r\n\r\n{18-a-Interp-2}\r\n2. *Application to employers and service providers.* Typically, employers and third-party service providers do not meet the definition of a \u201cfinancial institution\u201d subject to the regulation because they neither hold payroll card accounts nor issue payroll cards and agree with consumers to provide EFT services in connection with payroll card accounts. However, to the extent an employer or a service provider undertakes either of these functions, it would be deemed a financial institution under the regulation.\r\n\r\n{18-b-Interp}\r\n#### 18(b) Alternative to Periodic Statements\r\n\r\n{18-b-Interp-1}\r\n1. *Posted transactions.* A history of transactions provided under \u00a7\u00a7 1005.18(b)(1)(ii) and (iii) shall reflect transfers once they have been posted to the account. Thus, an institution does not need to include transactions that have been authorized, but that have not yet posted to the account.\r\n\r\n{18-b-Interp-2}\r\n2. *Electronic history.* The electronic history required under \u00a7 1005.18(b)(1)(ii) must be provided in a form that the consumer may keep, as required under \u00a7 1005.4(a)(1). Financial institutions may satisfy this requirement if they make the electronic history available in a format that is capable of being retained. For example, an institution satisfies the requirement if it provides a history at a Web site in a format that is capable of being printed or stored electronically using a web browser.\r\n\r\n{18-c-Interp}\r\n#### 18(c) Modified Requirements\r\n\r\n{18-c-Interp-1}\r\n1. *Error resolution safe harbor provision.* Institutions that choose to investigate notices of error provided up to 120 days from the date a transaction has posted to a consumer's account may still disclose the error resolution time period required by the regulation (as set forth in the Model Form in appendix A-7). Specifically, an institution may disclose to payroll card account holders that the institution will investigate any notice of error provided within 60 days of the consumer electronically accessing an account or receiving a written history upon request that reflects the error, even if, for some or all transactions, the institution investigates any notice of error provided up to 120 days from the date that the transaction alleged to be in error has posted to the consumer's account. Similarly, an institution's summary of the consumer's liability (as required under \u00a7 1005.7(b)(1)) may disclose that liability is based on the consumer providing notice of error within 60 days of the consumer electronically accessing an account or receiving a written history reflecting the error, even if, for some or all transactions, the institution allows a consumer to assert a notice of error up to 120 days from the date of posting of the alleged error.\r\n\r\n{18-c-Interp-2}\r\n2. *Electronic access.* A consumer is deemed to have accessed a payroll card account electronically when the consumer enters a user identification code or password or otherwise complies with a security procedure used by an institution to verify the consumer's identity. An institution is not required to determine whether a consumer has in fact accessed information about specific transactions to trigger the beginning of the 60-day periods for liability limits and error resolution under \u00a7\u00a7 1005.6 and 1005.11.\r\n\r\n{18-c-Interp-3}\r\n3. *Untimely notice of error.* An institution that provides a transaction history under \u00a7 1005.18(b)(1) is not required to comply with the requirements of \u00a7 1005.11 for any notice of error from the consumer pertaining to a transfer that occurred more than 60 days prior to the earlier of the date the consumer electronically accesses the account or the date the financial institution sends a written history upon the consumer's request. (Alternatively, as provided in \u00a7 1005.18(c)(4)(ii), an institution need not comply with the requirements of \u00a7 1005.11 with respect to any notice of error received from the consumer more than 120 days after the date of posting of the transfer allegedly in error.) Where the consumer's assertion of error involves an unauthorized EFT, however, the institution must comply with \u00a7 1005.6 before it may impose any liability on the consumer.\r\n\r\n",

        "subpart": 7,
        "contents": "{20-Interp}\r\n### Section 1005.20 Requirements for Gift Cards and Gift Certificates\r\n\r\n{20-a-Interp}\r\n#### 20(a) Definitions\r\n\r\n{20-a-Interp-1}\r\n1. *Form of card, code, or device.* Section 1005.20 applies to any card, code, or other device that meets one of the definitions in \u00a7\u00a7 1005.20(a)(1) through (a)(3) (and is not otherwise excluded by \u00a7 1005.20(b)), even if it is not issued in card form. Section 1005.20 applies, for example, to an account number or bar code that can be used to access underlying funds. Similarly, \u00a7 1005.20 applies to a device with a chip or other embedded mechanism that links the device to stored funds, such as a mobile phone or sticker containing a contactless chip that enables the consumer to access the stored funds. A card, code, or other device that meets the definition in \u00a7\u00a7 1005.20(a)(1) through (a)(3) includes an electronic promise ( *see* comment 20(a)-2) as well as a promise that is not electronic. *See, however,* \u00a7 1005.20(b)(5). In addition, \u00a7 1005.20 applies if a merchant issues a code that entitles a consumer to redeem the code for goods or services, regardless of the medium in which the code is issued ( *see, however,* \u00a7 1005.20(b)(5)), and whether or not it may be redeemed electronically or in the merchant's store. Thus, for example, if a merchant emails a code that a consumer may redeem in a specified amount either online or in the merchant's store, that code is covered under \u00a7 1005.20, unless one of the exclusions in \u00a7 1005.20(b) apply.\r\n\r\n{20-a-Interp-2}\r\n2. *Electronic promise.* The term \u201celectronic promise\u201d as used in EFTA sections 915(a)(2)(B), (a)(2)(C), and (a)(2)(D) means a person's commitment or obligation communicated or stored in electronic form made to a consumer to provide payment for goods or services for transactions initiated by the consumer. The electronic promise is itself represented by a card, code or other device that is issued or honored by the person, reflecting the person's commitment or obligation to pay. For example, if a merchant issues a code that can be given as a gift and that entitles the recipient to redeem the code in an online transaction for goods or services, that code represents an electronic promise by the merchant and is a card, code, or other device covered by \u00a7 1005.20.\r\n\r\n{20-a-Interp-3}\r\n3. *Cards, codes, or other devices redeemable for specific goods or services.* Certain cards, codes, or other devices may be redeemable upon presentation for a specific good or service, or \u201cexperience,\u201d such as a spa treatment, hotel stay, or airline flight. In other cases, a card, code, or other device may entitle the consumer to a certain percentage off the purchase of a good or service, such as 20% off of any purchase in a store. Such cards, codes, or other devices generally are not subject to the requirements of this section because they are not issued to a consumer \u201cin a specified amount\u201d as required under the definitions of \u201cgift certificate,\u201d \u201cstore gift card,\u201d or \u201cgeneral-use prepaid card.\u201d However, if the card, code, or other device is issued in a specified or denominated amount that can be applied toward the purchase of a specific good or service, such as a certificate or card redeemable for a spa treatment up to $50, the card, code, or other device is subject to this section, unless one of the exceptions in \u00a7 1005.20(b) apply. *See, e.g.,* \u00a7 1005.20(b)(3). Similarly, if the card, code, or other device states a specific monetary value, such as \u201ca $50 value,\u201d the card, code, or other device is subject to this section, unless an exclusion in \u00a7 1005.20(b) applies.\r\n\r\n{20-a-Interp-4}\r\n4. *Issued primarily for personal, family, or household purposes.* Section 1005.20 only applies to cards, codes, or other devices that are sold or issued to a consumer primarily for personal, family, or household purposes. A card, code, or other device initially purchased by a business is subject to this section if the card, code, or other device is purchased for redistribution or resale to consumers primarily for personal, family, or household purposes. Moreover, the fact that a card, code, or other device may be primarily funded by a business, for example, in the case of certain rewards or incentive cards, does not mean the card, code, or other device is outside the scope of \u00a7 1005.20, if the card, code, or other device will be provided to a consumer primarily for personal, family, or household purposes. *But see* \u00a7 1005.20(b)(3). Whether a card, code, or other device is issued to a consumer primarily for personal, family, or household purposes will depend on the facts and circumstances. For example, if a program manager purchases store gift cards directly from an issuing merchant and sells those cards through the program manager's retail outlets, such gift cards are subject to the requirements of \u00a7 1005.20 because the store gift cards are sold to consumers primarily for personal, family, or household purposes. In contrast, a card, code, or other device generally would not be issued to consumers primarily for personal, family, or household purposes, and therefore would fall outside the scope of \u00a7 1005.20, if the purchaser of the card, code, or device is contractually prohibited from reselling or redistributing the card, code, or device to consumers primarily for personal, family, or household purposes, and reasonable policies and procedures are maintained to avoid such sale or distribution for such purposes. However, if an entity that has purchased cards, codes, or other devices for business purposes sells or distributes such cards, codes, or other devices to consumers primarily for personal, family, or household purposes, that entity does not comply with \u00a7 1005.20 if it has not otherwise met the substantive and disclosure requirements of the rule or unless an exclusion in \u00a7 1005.20(b) applies.\r\n\r\n{20-a-Interp-5}\r\n5. *Examples of cards, codes, or other devices issued for business purposes.* Examples of cards, codes, or other devices that are issued and used for business purposes and therefore excluded from the definitions of \u201cgift certificate,\u201d \u201cstore gift card,\u201d or \u201cgeneral-use prepaid card\u201d include:\r\n\r\n{20-a-Interp-5-i}\r\ni. Cards, codes, or other devices to reimburse employees for travel or moving expenses.\r\n\r\n{20-a-Interp-5-ii}\r\nii. Cards, codes, or other devices for employees to use to purchase office supplies and other business-related items.\r\n\r\n{20-a-2-Interp}\r\n#### 20(a)(2) Store Gift Card\r\n\r\n{20-a-2-Interp-1}\r\n1. *Relationship between \u201cgift certificate\u201d and \u201cstore gift card.\u201d* The term \u201cstore gift card\u201d in \u00a7 1005.20(a)(2) includes \u201cgift certificate\u201d as defined in \u00a7 1005.20(a)(1). For example, a numeric or alphanumeric code representing a specified dollar amount or value that is electronically sent to a consumer as a gift which can be redeemed or exchanged by the recipient to obtain goods or services may be both a \u201cgift certificate\u201d and a \u201cstore gift card\u201d if the specified amount or value cannot be increased.\r\n\r\n{20-a-2-Interp-2}\r\n2. *Affiliated group of merchants.* The term \u201caffiliated group of merchants\u201d means two or more affiliated merchants or other persons that are related by common ownership or common corporate control ( *see, e.g.,* 12 CFR 227.3(b) and 12 CFR 223.2) and that share the same name, mark, or logo. For example, the term includes franchisees that are subject to a common set of corporate policies or practices under the terms of their franchise licenses. The term also applies to two or more merchants or other persons that agree among themselves, by contract or otherwise, to redeem cards, codes, or other devices bearing the same name, mark, or logo (other than the mark, logo, or brand of a payment network), for the purchase of goods or services solely at such merchants or persons. For example, assume a movie theatre chain and a restaurant chain jointly agree to issue cards that share the same \u201cFlix and Food\u201d logo that can be redeemed solely towards the purchase of movie tickets or concessions at any of the participating movie theatres, or towards the purchase of food or beverages at any of the participating restaurants. For purposes of \u00a7 1005.20, the movie theatre chain and the restaurant chain would be considered to be an affiliated group of merchants, and the cards are considered to be \u201cstore gift cards.\u201d However, merchants or other persons are not considered to be affiliated merely because they agree to accept a card that bears the mark, logo, or brand of a payment network.\r\n\r\n{20-a-2-Interp-3}\r\n3. *Mall gift cards. See* comment 20(a)(3)-2.\r\n\r\n{20-a-3-Interp}\r\n#### 20(a)(3) General-Use Prepaid Card\r\n\r\n{20-a-3-Interp-1}\r\n1. *Redeemable upon presentation at multiple, unaffiliated merchants.* A card, code, or other device is redeemable upon presentation at multiple, unaffiliated merchants if, for example, such merchants agree to honor the card, code, or device if it bears the mark, logo, or brand of a payment network, pursuant to the rules of the payment network.\r\n\r\n{20-a-3-Interp-2}\r\n2. *Mall gift cards.* Mall gift cards that are intended to be used or redeemed for goods or services at participating retailers within a shopping mall may be considered store gift cards or general-use prepaid cards depending on the merchants with which the cards may be redeemed. For example, if a mall card may only be redeemed at merchants within the mall itself, the card is more likely to be redeemable at an affiliated group of merchants and considered a store gift card. However, certain mall cards also carry the brand of a payment network and can be used at any retailer that accepts that card brand, including retailers located outside of the mall. Such cards are considered general-use prepaid cards.\r\n\r\n{20-a-4-Interp}\r\n#### 20(a)(4) Loyalty, Award, or Promotional Gift Card\r\n\r\n{20-a-4-Interp-1}\r\n1. *Examples of loyalty, award, or promotional programs.* Examples of loyalty, award, or promotional programs under \u00a7 1005.20(a)(4) include, but are not limited to:\r\n\r\n{20-a-4-Interp-1-i}\r\ni. Consumer retention programs operated or administered by a merchant or other person that provide to consumers cards or coupons redeemable for or towards goods or services or other monetary value as a reward for purchases made or for visits to the participating merchant.\r\n\r\n{20-a-4-Interp-1-ii}\r\nii. Sales promotions operated or administered by a merchant or product manufacturer that provide coupons or discounts redeemable for or towards goods or services or other monetary value.\r\n\r\n{20-a-4-Interp-1-iii}\r\niii. Rebate programs operated or administered by a merchant or product manufacturer that provide cards redeemable for or towards goods or services or other monetary value to consumers in connection with the consumer's purchase of a product or service and the consumer's completion of the rebate submission process.\r\n\r\n{20-a-4-Interp-1-iv}\r\niv. Sweepstakes or contests that distribute cards redeemable for or towards goods or services or other monetary value to consumers as an invitation to enter into the promotion for a chance to win a prize.\r\n\r\n{20-a-4-Interp-1-v}\r\nv. Referral programs that provide cards redeemable for or towards goods or services or other monetary value to consumers in exchange for referring other potential consumers to a merchant.\r\n\r\n{20-a-4-Interp-1-vi}\r\nvi. Incentive programs through which an employer provides cards redeemable for or towards goods or services or other monetary value to employees, for example, to recognize job performance, such as increased sales, or to encourage employee wellness and safety.\r\n\r\n{20-a-4-Interp-1-vii}\r\nvii. Charitable or community relations programs through which a company provides cards redeemable for or towards goods or services or other monetary value to a charity or community group for their fundraising purposes, for example, as a reward for a donation or as a prize in a charitable event.\r\n\r\n{20-a-4-Interp-2}\r\n2. *Issued for loyalty, award, or promotional purposes.* To indicate that a card, code, or other device is issued for loyalty, award, or promotional purposes as required by \u00a7 1005.20(a)(4)(iii), it is sufficient for the card, code, or other device to state on the front, for example, \u201cReward\u201d or \u201cPromotional.\u201d\r\n\r\n{20-a-4-Interp-3}\r\n3. *Reference to toll-free number and Web site.* If a card, code, or other device issued in connection with a loyalty, award, or promotional program does not have any fees, the disclosure under \u00a7 1005.20(a)(4)(iii)(D) is not required on the card, code, or other device.\r\n\r\n{20-a-6-Interp}\r\n#### 20(a)(6) Service Fee\r\n\r\n{20-a-6-Interp-1}\r\n1. *Service fees.* Under \u00a7 1005.20(a)(6), a service fee includes a periodic fee for holding or use of a gift certificate, store gift card, or general-use prepaid card. A periodic fee includes any fee that may be imposed on a gift certificate, store gift card, or general-use prepaid card from time to time for holding or using the certificate or card, such as a monthly maintenance fee, a transaction fee, an ATM fee, a reload fee, a foreign currency transaction fee, or a balance inquiry fee, whether or not the fee is waived for a certain period of time or is only imposed after a certain period of time. A service fee does not include a one-time fee or a fee that is unlikely to be imposed more than once while the underlying funds are still valid, such as an initial issuance fee, a cash-out fee, a supplemental card fee, or a lost or stolen certificate or card replacement fee.\r\n\r\n{20-a-7-Interp}\r\n#### 20(a)(7) Activity\r\n\r\n{20-a-7-Interp-1}\r\n1. *Activity.* Under \u00a7 1005.20(a)(7), any action that results in an increase or decrease of the funds underlying a gift certificate, store gift card, or general-use prepaid card, other than the imposition of a fee, or an adjustment due to an error or a reversal of a prior transaction, constitutes activity for purposes of \u00a7 1005.20. For example, the purchase and activation of a certificate or card, the use of the certificate or card to purchase a good or service, or the reloading of funds onto a store gift card or general-use prepaid card constitutes activity. However, the imposition of a fee, the replacement of an expired, lost, or stolen certificate or card, and a balance inquiry do not constitute activity. In addition, if a consumer attempts to engage in a transaction with a gift certificate, store gift card, or general-use prepaid card, but the transaction cannot be completed due to technical or other reasons, such attempt does not constitute activity. Furthermore, if the funds underlying a gift certificate, store gift card, or general-use prepaid card are adjusted because there was an error or the consumer has returned a previously purchased good, the adjustment also does not constitute activity with respect to the certificate or card.\r\n\r\n{20-b-Interp}\r\n#### 20(b) Exclusions\r\n\r\n{20-b-Interp-1}\r\n1. *Application of exclusion.* A card, code, or other device is excluded from the definition of \u201cgift certificate,\u201d \u201cstore gift card,\u201d or \u201cgeneral-use prepaid card\u201d if it meets any of the exclusions in \u00a7 1005.20(b). An excluded card, code, or other device generally is not subject to any of the requirements of this section. *See, however,* \u00a7 1005.20(a)(4)(iii), requiring certain disclosures for loyalty, award, or promotional gift cards.\r\n\r\n{20-b-Interp-2}\r\n2. *Eligibility for multiple exclusions.* A card, code, or other device may qualify for one or more exclusions. For example, a corporation may give its employees a gift card that is marketed solely to businesses for incentive-related purposes, such as to reward job performance or promote employee safety. In this case, the card may qualify for the exclusion for loyalty, award, or promotional gift cards under \u00a7 1005.20(b)(3), or for the exclusion for cards, codes, or other devices not marketed to the general public under \u00a7 1005.20(b)(4). In addition, as long as any one of the exclusions applies, a card, code, or other device is not covered by \u00a7 1005.20, even if other exclusions do not apply. In the above example, the corporation may give its employees a type of gift card that can also be purchased by a consumer directly from a merchant. Under these circumstances, while the card does not qualify for the exclusion for cards, codes, or other devices not marketed to the general public under \u00a7 1005.20(b)(4) because the card can also be obtained through retail channels, it is nevertheless exempt from the substantive requirements of \u00a7 1005.20 because it is a loyalty, award, or promotional gift card. *See, however,* \u00a7 1005.20(a)(4)(iii), requiring certain disclosures for loyalty, award, or promotional gift cards. Similarly, a person may market a reloadable card to teenagers for occasional expenses that enables parents to monitor spending. Although the card does not qualify for the exclusion for cards, codes, or other devices not marketed to the general public under \u00a7 1005.20(b)(4), it may nevertheless be exempt from the requirements of \u00a7 1005.20 under \u00a7 1005.20(b)(2) if it is reloadable and not marketed or labeled as a gift card or gift certificate.\r\n\r\n{20-b-1-Interp}\r\n#### Paragraph 20(b)(1)\r\n\r\n{20-b-1-Interp-1}\r\n1. *Examples of excluded products.* The exclusion for products usable solely for telephone services applies to prepaid cards for long-distance telephone service, prepaid cards for wireless telephone service and prepaid cards for other services that function similar to telephone services, such as prepaid cards for voice over Internet protocol (VoIP) access time.\r\n\r\n{20-b-2-Interp}\r\n#### Paragraph 20(b)(2)\r\n\r\n{20-b-2-Interp-1}\r\n1. *Reloadable.* A card, code, or other device is \u201creloadable\u201d if the terms and conditions of the agreement permit funds to be added to the card, code, or other device after the initial purchase or issuance. A card, code, or other device is not \u201creloadable\u201d merely because the issuer or processor is technically able to add functionality that would otherwise enable the card, code, or other device to be reloaded.\r\n\r\n{20-b-2-Interp-2}\r\n2. *Marketed or labeled as a gift card or gift certificate.* The term \u201cmarketed or labeled as a gift card or gift certificate\u201d means directly or indirectly offering, advertising, or otherwise suggesting the potential use of a card, code or other device, as a gift for another person. Whether the exclusion applies generally does not depend on the type of entity that makes the promotional message. For example, a card may be marketed or labeled as a gift card or gift certificate if anyone (other than the purchaser of the card), including the issuer, the retailer, the program manager that may distribute the card, or the payment network on which a card is used, promotes the use of the card as a gift card or gift certificate. A card, code, or other device, including a general-purpose reloadable card, is marketed or labeled as a gift card or gift certificate even if it is only occasionally marketed as a gift card or gift certificate. For example, a network-branded general purpose reloadable card would be marketed or labeled as a gift card or gift certificate if the issuer principally advertises the card as a less costly alternative to a bank account but promotes the card in a television, radio, newspaper, or Internet advertisement, or on signage as \u201cthe perfect gift\u201d during the holiday season. However, the mere mention of the availability of gift cards or gift certificates in an advertisement or on a sign that also indicates the availability of other excluded prepaid cards does not by itself cause the excluded prepaid cards to be marketed as a gift card or a gift certificate. For example, the posting of a sign in a store that refers to the availability of gift cards does not by itself constitute the marketing of otherwise excluded prepaid cards that may also be sold in the store as gift cards or gift certificates, provided that a consumer acting reasonably under the circumstances would not be led to believe that the sign applies to all prepaid cards sold in the store. *See, however,* comment 20(b)(2)-4.ii.\r\n\r\n{20-b-2-Interp-3}\r\n3. *Examples of marketed or labeled as a gift card or gift certificate.*\r\n\r\n{20-b-2-Interp-3-i}\r\ni. Examples of marketed or labeled as a gift card or gift certificate include:\r\n\r\n{20-b-2-Interp-3-i-A}\r\nA. Using the word \u201cgift\u201d or \u201cpresent\u201d on a card, certificate, or accompanying material, including documentation, packaging and promotional displays.\r\n\r\n{20-b-2-Interp-3-i-B}\r\nB. Representing or suggesting that a certificate or card can be given to another person, for example, as a \u201ctoken of appreciation\u201d or a \u201cstocking stuffer,\u201d or displaying a congratulatory message on the card, certificate or accompanying material.\r\n\r\n{20-b-2-Interp-3-i-C}\r\nC. Incorporating gift-giving or celebratory imagery or motifs, such as a bow, ribbon, wrapped present, candle, or congratulatory message, on a card, certificate, accompanying documentation, or promotional material.\r\n\r\n{20-b-2-Interp-3-ii}\r\nii. The term does not include:\r\n\r\n{20-b-2-Interp-3-ii-A}\r\nA. Representing that a card or certificate can be used as a substitute for a checking, savings, or deposit account.\r\n\r\n{20-b-2-Interp-3-ii-B}\r\nB. Representing that a card or certificate can be used to pay for a consumer's health-related expenses - for example, a card tied to a health savings account.\r\n\r\n{20-b-2-Interp-3-ii-C}\r\nC. Representing that a card or certificate can be used as a substitute for traveler's checks or cash.\r\n\r\n{20-b-2-Interp-3-ii-D}\r\nD. Representing that a card or certificate can be used as a budgetary tool, for example, by teenagers, or to cover emergency expenses.\r\n\r\n{20-b-2-Interp-4}\r\n4. *Reasonable policies and procedures to avoid marketing as a gift card.* The exclusion for a card, code, or other device that is reloadable and not marketed or labeled as a gift card or gift certificate in \u00a7 1005.20(b)(2) applies if a reloadable card, code, or other device is not marketed or labeled as a gift card or gift certificate and if persons subject to the rule, including issuers, program managers, and retailers, maintain policies and procedures reasonably designed to avoid such marketing. Such policies and procedures may include contractual provisions prohibiting a reloadable card, code, or other device from being marketed or labeled as a gift card or gift certificate, merchandising guidelines or plans regarding how the product must be displayed in a retail outlet, and controls to regularly monitor or otherwise verify that the card, code or other device is not being marketed as a gift card. Whether a reloadable card, code, or other device has been marketed as a gift card or gift certificate will depend on the facts and circumstances, including whether a reasonable consumer would be led to believe that the card, code, or other device is a gift card or gift certificate. The following examples illustrate the application of \u00a7 1005.20(b)(2):\r\n\r\n{20-b-2-Interp-4-i}\r\ni. An issuer or program manager of prepaid cards agrees to sell general-purpose reloadable cards through a retailer. The contract between the issuer or program manager and the retailer establishes the terms and conditions under which the cards may be sold and marketed at the retailer. The terms and conditions prohibit the general-purpose reloadable cards from being marketed as a gift card or gift certificate, and require policies and procedures to regularly monitor or otherwise verify that the cards are not being marketed as such. The issuer or program manager sets up one promotional display at the retailer for gift cards and another physically separated display for excluded products under \u00a7 1005.20(b), including general-purpose reloadable cards and wireless telephone cards, such that a reasonable consumer would not believe that the excluded cards are gift cards. The exclusion in \u00a7 1005.20(b)(2) applies because policies and procedures reasonably designed to avoid the marketing of the general-purpose reloadable cards as gift cards or gift certificates are maintained, even if a retail clerk inadvertently stocks or a consumer inadvertently places a general-purpose reloadable card on the gift card display.\r\n\r\n{20-b-2-Interp-4-ii}\r\nii. Same facts as in i., except that the issuer or program manager sets up a single promotional display at the retailer on which a variety of prepaid cards are sold, including store gift cards and general-purpose reloadable cards. A sign stating \u201cGift Cards\u201d appears prominently at the top of the display. The exclusion in \u00a7 1005.20(b)(2) does not apply with respect to the general-purpose reloadable cards because policies and procedures reasonably designed to avoid the marketing of excluded cards as gift cards or gift certificates are not maintained.\r\n\r\n{20-b-2-Interp-4-iii}\r\niii. Same facts as in i., except that the issuer or program manager sets up a single promotional multi-sided display at the retailer on which a variety of prepaid card products, including store gift cards and general-purpose reloadable cards are sold. Gift cards are segregated from excluded cards, with gift cards on one side of the display and excluded cards on a different side of a display. Signs of equal prominence at the top of each side of the display clearly differentiate between gift cards and the other types of prepaid cards that are available for sale. The retailer does not use any more conspicuous signage suggesting the general availability of gift cards, such as a large sign stating \u201cGift Cards\u201d at the top of the display or located near the display. The exclusion in \u00a7 1005.20(b)(2) applies because policies and procedures reasonably designed to avoid the marketing of the general-purpose reloadable cards as gift cards or gift certificates are maintained, even if a retail clerk inadvertently stocks or a consumer inadvertently places a general-purpose reloadable card on the gift card display.\r\n\r\n{20-b-2-Interp-4-iv}\r\niv. Same facts as in i., except that the retailer sells a variety of prepaid card products, including store gift cards and general-purpose reloadable cards, arranged side-by-side in the same checkout lane. The retailer does not affirmatively indicate or represent that gift cards are available, such as by displaying any signage or other indicia at the checkout lane suggesting the general availability of gift cards. The exclusion in \u00a7 1005.20(b)(2) applies because policies and procedures reasonably designed to avoid marketing the general-purpose reloadable cards as gift cards or gift certificates are maintained.\r\n\r\n{20-b-2-Interp-5}\r\n5. *Online sales of prepaid cards.* Some Web sites may prominently advertise or promote the availability of gift cards or gift certificates in a manner that suggests to a consumer that the Web site exclusively sells gift cards or gift certificates. For example, a Web site may display a banner advertisement or a graphic on the home page that prominently states \u201cGift Cards,\u201d \u201cGift Giving,\u201d or similar language without mention of other available products, or use a web address that includes only a reference to gift cards or gift certificates in the address. In such a case, a consumer acting reasonably under the circumstances could be led to believe that all prepaid products sold on the Web site are gift cards or gift certificates. Under these facts, the Web site has marketed all such products, including general-purpose reloadable cards, as gift cards or gift certificates, and the exclusion in \u00a7 1005.20(b)(2) does not apply.\r\n\r\n{20-b-2-Interp-6}\r\n6. *Temporary non-reloadable cards issued in connection with a general-purpose reloadable card.* Certain general-purpose reloadable cards that are typically marketed as an account substitute initially may be sold or issued in the form of a temporary non-reloadable card. After the card is purchased, the cardholder is typically required to call the issuer to register the card and to provide identifying information in order to obtain a reloadable replacement card. In most cases, the temporary non-reloadable card can be used for purchases until the replacement reloadable card arrives and is activated by the cardholder. Because the temporary non-reloadable card may only be obtained in connection with the general-purpose reloadable card, the exclusion in \u00a7 1005.20(b)(2) applies so long as the card is not marketed as a gift card or gift certificate.\r\n\r\n{20-b-4-Interp}\r\n#### Paragraph 20(b)(4)\r\n\r\n{20-b-4-Interp-1}\r\n1. *Marketed to the general public.* A card, code, or other device is marketed to the general public if the potential use of the card, code, or other device is directly or indirectly offered, advertised, or otherwise promoted to the general public. A card, code, or other device may be marketed to the general public through any advertising medium, including television, radio, newspaper, the Internet, or signage. However, the posting of a company policy that funds may be disbursed by prepaid card (such as a sign posted at a cash register or customer service center stating that store credit will be issued by prepaid card) does not constitute the marketing of a card, code, or other device to the general public. In addition, the method of distribution by itself is not dispositive in determining whether a card, code, or other device is marketed to the general public. Factors that may be considered in determining whether the exclusion applies to a particular card, code, or other device include the means or channel through which the card, code, or device may be obtained by a consumer, the subset of consumers that are eligible to obtain the card, code, or device, and whether the availability of the card, code, or device is advertised or otherwise promoted in the marketplace.\r\n\r\n{20-b-4-Interp-2}\r\n2. *Examples.* The following examples illustrate the application of the exclusion in \u00a7 1005.20(b)(4):\r\n\r\n{20-b-4-Interp-2-i}\r\ni. A merchant sells its gift cards at a discount to a business which may give them to employees or loyal consumers as incentives or rewards. In determining whether the gift card falls within the exclusion in \u00a7 1005.20(b)(4), the merchant must consider whether the card is of a type that is advertised or made available to consumers generally or can be obtained elsewhere. If the card can also be purchased through retail channels, the exclusion in \u00a7 1005.20(b)(4) does not apply, even if the consumer obtained the card from the business as an incentive or reward. *See, however,* \u00a7 1005.20(b)(3).\r\n\r\n{20-b-4-Interp-2-ii}\r\nii. A national retail chain decides to market its gift cards only to members of its frequent buyer program. Similarly, a bank may decide to sell gift cards only to its customers. If a member of the general public may become a member of the program or a customer of the bank, the card does not fall within the exclusion in \u00a7 1005.20(b)(4) because the general public has the ability to obtain the cards. *See, however,* \u00a7 1005.20(b)(3).\r\n\r\n{20-b-4-Interp-2-iii}\r\niii. A card issuer advertises a reloadable card to teenagers and their parents promoting the card for use by teenagers for occasional expenses, schoolbooks and emergencies and by parents to monitor spending. Because the card is marketed to and may be sold to any member of the general public, the exclusion in \u00a7 1005.20(b)(4) does not apply. *See, however,* \u00a7 1005.20(b)(2).\r\n\r\n{20-b-4-Interp-2-iv}\r\niv. An insurance company settles a policyholder's claim and distributes the insurance proceeds to the consumer by means of a prepaid card. Because the prepaid card is simply the means for providing the insurance proceeds to the consumer and the availability of the card is not advertised to the general public, the exclusion in \u00a7 1005.20(b)(4) applies.\r\n\r\n{20-b-4-Interp-2-v}\r\nv. A merchant provides store credit to a consumer following a merchandise return by issuing a prepaid card that clearly indicates that the card contains funds for store credit. Because the prepaid card is issued for the stated purpose of providing store credit to the consumer and the ability to receive refunds by a prepaid card is not advertised to the general public, the exclusion in \u00a7 1005.20(b)(4) applies.\r\n\r\n{20-b-4-Interp-2-vi}\r\nvi. A tax preparation company elects to distribute tax refunds to its clients by issuing prepaid cards, but does not advertise or otherwise promote the ability to receive proceeds in this manner. Because the prepaid card is simply the mechanism for providing the tax refund to the consumer, and the tax preparer does not advertise the ability to obtain tax refunds by a prepaid card, the exclusion in \u00a7 1005.20(b)(4) applies. However, if the tax preparer promotes the ability to receive tax refund proceeds through a prepaid card as a way to obtain \u201cfaster\u201d access to the proceeds, the exclusion in \u00a7 1005.20(b)(4) does not apply.\r\n\r\n{20-b-5-Interp}\r\n#### Paragraph 20(b)(5)\r\n\r\n{20-b-5-Interp-1}\r\n1. *Exclusion explained.* To qualify for the exclusion in \u00a7 1005.20(b)(5), the sole means of issuing the card, code, or other device must be in a paper form. Thus, the exclusion generally applies to certificates issued in paper form where solely the paper itself may be used to purchase goods or services. A card, code or other device is not issued solely in paper form simply because it may be reproduced or printed on paper. For example, a bar code, card or certificate number, or certificate or coupon electronically provided to a consumer and redeemable for goods and services is not issued in paper form, even if it may be reproduced or otherwise printed on paper by the consumer. In this circumstance, although the consumer might hold a paper facsimile of the card, code, or other device, the exclusion does not apply because the information necessary to redeem the value was initially issued in electronic form. A paper certificate is within the exclusion regardless of whether it may be redeemed electronically. For example, a paper certificate or receipt that bears a bar code, code, or account number falls within the exclusion in \u00a7 1005.20(b)(5) if the bar code, code, or account number is not issued in any form other than on the paper. In addition, the exclusion in \u00a7 1005.20(b)(5) continues to apply in circumstances where an issuer replaces a gift certificate that was initially issued in paper form with a card or electronic code (for example, to replace a lost paper certificate).\r\n\r\n{20-b-5-Interp-2}\r\n2. *Examples.* The following examples illustrate the application of the exclusion in \u00a7 1005.20(b)(5):\r\n\r\n{20-b-5-Interp-2-i}\r\ni. A merchant issues a paper gift certificate that entitles the bearer to a specified dollar amount that can be applied towards a future meal. The merchant fills in the certificate with the name of the certificate holder and the amount of the certificate. The certificate falls within the exclusion in \u00a7 1005.20(b)(5) because it is issued in paper form only.\r\n\r\n{20-b-5-Interp-2-ii}\r\nii. A merchant allows a consumer to prepay for a good or service, such as a car wash or time at a parking meter, and issues a paper receipt bearing a numerical or bar code that the consumer may redeem to obtain the good or service. The exclusion in \u00a7 1005.20(b)(5) applies because the code is issued in paper form only.\r\n\r\n{20-b-5-Interp-2-iii}\r\niii. A merchant issues a paper certificate or receipt bearing a bar code or certificate number that can later be scanned or entered into the merchant's system and redeemed by the certificate or receipt holder towards the purchase of goods or services. The bar code or certificate number is not issued by the merchant in any form other than paper. The exclusion in \u00a7 1005.20(b)(5) applies because the bar code or certificate number is issued in paper form only.\r\n\r\n{20-b-5-Interp-2-iv}\r\niv. An online merchant electronically provides a bar code, card or certificate number, or certificate or coupon to a consumer that the consumer may print on a home printer and later redeem towards the purchase of goods or services. The exclusion in \u00a7 1005.20(b)(5) does not apply because the bar code or card or certificate number was issued to the consumer in electronic form, even though it can be reproduced or otherwise printed on paper by the consumer.\r\n\r\n{20-b-6-Interp}\r\n#### Paragraph 20(b)(6)\r\n\r\n{20-b-6-Interp-1}\r\n1. *Exclusion explained.* The exclusion for cards, codes, or other devices that are redeemable solely for admission to events or venues at a particular location or group of affiliated locations generally applies to cards, codes, or other devices that are not redeemed for a specified monetary value, but rather solely for admission or entry to an event or venue. The exclusion also covers a card, code, or other device that is usable to purchase goods or services in addition to entry into the event or the venue, either at the event or venue or at an affiliated location or location in geographic proximity to the event or venue.\r\n\r\n{20-b-6-Interp-2}\r\n2. *Examples.* The following examples illustrate the application of the exclusion in \u00a7 1005.20(b)(6):\r\n\r\n{20-b-6-Interp-2-i}\r\ni. A consumer purchases a prepaid card that entitles the holder to a ticket for entry to an amusement park. The prepaid card may only be used for entry to the park. The card qualifies for the exclusion in \u00a7 1005.20(b)(6) because it is redeemable for admission or entry and for goods or services in conjunction with that admission. In addition, if the prepaid card does not have a monetary value, and therefore is not \u201cissued in a specified amount,\u201d the card does not meet the definitions of \u201cgift certificate,\u201d \u201cstore gift card,\u201d or \u201cgeneral-use prepaid card\u201d in \u00a7 1005.20(a). *See* comment 20(a)-3.\r\n\r\n{20-b-6-Interp-2-ii}\r\nii. Same facts as in i., except that the gift card also entitles the holder of the gift card to a dollar amount that can be applied towards the purchase of food and beverages or goods or services at the park or at nearby affiliated locations. The card qualifies for the exclusion in \u00a7 1005.20(b)(6) because it is redeemable for admission or entry and for goods or services in conjunction with that admission.\r\n\r\n{20-b-6-Interp-2-iii}\r\niii. A consumer purchases a $25 gift card that the holder of the gift card can use to make purchases at a merchant, or, alternatively, can apply towards the cost of admission to the merchant's affiliated amusement park. The card is not eligible for the exclusion in \u00a7 1005.20(b)(6) because it is not redeemable solely for the admission or ticket itself (or for goods and services purchased in conjunction with such admission). The card meets the definition of \u201cstore gift card\u201d and is therefore subject to \u00a7 1005.20, unless a different exclusion applies.\r\n\r\n{20-c-Interp}\r\n#### 20(c) Form of Disclosures\r\n\r\n{20-c-1-Interp}\r\n#### 20(c)(1) Clear and Conspicuous\r\n\r\n{20-c-1-Interp-1}\r\n1. *Clear and conspicuous standard.* All disclosures required by this section must be clear and conspicuous. Disclosures are clear and conspicuous for purposes of this section if they are readily understandable and, in the case of written and electronic disclosures, the location and type size are readily noticeable to consumers. Disclosures need not be located on the front of the certificate or card, except where otherwise required, to be considered clear and conspicuous. Disclosures are clear and conspicuous for the purposes of this section if they are in a print that contrasts with and is otherwise not obstructed by the background on which they are printed. For example, disclosures on a card or computer screen are not likely to be conspicuous if obscured by a logo printed in the background. Similarly, disclosures on the back of a card that are printed on top of indentations from embossed type on the front of the card are not likely to be conspicuous if the indentations obstruct the readability of the disclosures. To the extent permitted, oral disclosures meet the standard when they are given at a volume and speed sufficient for a consumer to hear and comprehend them.\r\n\r\n{20-c-1-Interp-2}\r\n2. *Abbreviations and symbols.* Disclosures may contain commonly accepted or readily understandable abbreviations or symbols, such as \u201cmo.\u201d for month or a \u201c/\u201d to indicate \u201cper.\u201d Under the clear and conspicuous standard, it is sufficient to state, for example, that a particular fee is charged \u201c$2.50/mo. after 12 mos.\u201d\r\n\r\n{20-c-2-Interp}\r\n#### 20(c)(2) Format\r\n\r\n{20-c-2-Interp-1}\r\n1. *Electronic disclosures.* Disclosures provided electronically pursuant to this section are not subject to compliance with the consumer consent and other applicable provisions of the Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act (E-Sign Act) (15 U.S.C. 7001 *et seq.).* Electronic disclosures must be in a retainable form. For example, a person may satisfy the requirement if it provides an online disclosure in a format that is capable of being printed. Electronic disclosures may not be provided through a hyperlink or in another manner by which the purchaser can bypass the disclosure. A person is not required to confirm that the consumer has read the electronic disclosures.\r\n\r\n{20-c-3-Interp}\r\n#### 20(c)(3) Disclosure Prior to Purchase\r\n\r\n{20-c-3-Interp-1}\r\n1. *Method of purchase.* The disclosures required by this paragraph must be provided before a certificate or card is purchased regardless of whether the certificate or card is purchased in person, online, by telephone, or by other means.\r\n\r\n{20-c-3-Interp-2}\r\n2. *Electronic disclosures.* Section 1005.20(c)(3) provides that the disclosures required by this section must be provided to the consumer prior to purchase. For certificates or cards purchased electronically, disclosures made to the consumer after a consumer has initiated an online purchase of a certificate or card, but prior to completing the purchase of the certificate or card, would satisfy the prior-to-purchase requirement. However, electronic disclosures made available on a person's Web site that may or may not be accessed by the consumer are not provided to the consumer and therefore would not satisfy the prior-to-purchase requirement.\r\n\r\n{20-c-3-Interp-3}\r\n3. *Non-physical certificates and cards.* If no physical certificate or card is issued, the disclosures must be provided to the consumer before the certificate or card is purchased. For example, where a gift certificate or card is a code that is provided by telephone, the required disclosures may be provided orally prior to purchase. *See also* \u00a7 1005.20(c)(2).\r\n\r\n{20-c-4-Interp}\r\n#### 20(c)(4) Disclosures on the Certificate or Card\r\n\r\n{20-c-4-Interp-1}\r\n1. *Non-physical certificates and cards.* If no physical certificate or card is issued, the disclosures required by this paragraph must be disclosed on the code, confirmation, or other written or electronic document provided to the consumer. For example, where a gift certificate or card is a code or confirmation that is provided to a consumer online or sent to a consumer's email address, the required disclosures may be provided electronically on the same document as the code or confirmation.2. *No disclosures on a certificate or card.* Disclosures required by \u00a7 1005.20(c)(4) need not be made on a certificate or card if it is accompanied by a certificate or card that complies with this section. For example, a person may issue or sell a supplemental gift card that is smaller than a standard size and that does not bear the applicable disclosures if it is accompanied by a fully compliant certificate or card. *See also* comment 20(c)(2)-2.\r\n\r\n{20-d-Interp}\r\n#### 20(d) Prohibition on Imposition of Fees or Charges\r\n\r\n{20-d-Interp-1}\r\n1. *One-year period.* Section 1005.20(d) provides that a person may impose a dormancy, inactivity, or service fee only if there has been no activity with respect to a certificate or card for one year. The following examples illustrate this rule:\r\n\r\n{20-d-Interp-1-i}\r\ni. A certificate or card is purchased on January 15 of year one. If there has been no activity on the certificate or card since the certificate or card was purchased, a dormancy, inactivity, or service fee may be imposed on the certificate or card on January 15 of year two.\r\n\r\n{20-d-Interp-1-ii}\r\nii. Same facts as i., and a fee was imposed on January 15 of year two. Because no more than one dormancy, inactivity, or service fee may be imposed in any given calendar month, the earliest date that another dormancy, inactivity, or service fee may be imposed, assuming there continues to be no activity on the certificate or card, is February 1 of year two. A dormancy, inactivity, or service fee is permitted to be imposed on February 1 of year two because there has been no activity on the certificate or card for the preceding year (February 1 of year one through January 31 of year two), and February is a new calendar month. The imposition of a fee on January 15 of year two is not activity for purposes of \u00a7 1005.20(d). *See* comment 20(a)(7)-1.\r\n\r\n{20-d-Interp-1-iii}\r\niii. Same facts as i., and a fee was imposed on January 15 of year two. On January 31 of year two, the consumer uses the card to make a purchase. Another dormancy, inactivity, or service fee could not be imposed until January 31 of year three, assuming there has been no activity on the certificate or card since January 31 of year two.\r\n\r\n{20-d-Interp-2}\r\n2. *Relationship between \u00a7\u00a7 1005.20(d)(2) and (c)(3).* Sections 1005.20(d)(2) and (c)(3) contain similar, but not identical, disclosure requirements. Section 1005.20(d)(2) requires the disclosure of dormancy, inactivity, and service fees on a certificate or card. Section 1005.20(c)(3) requires that vendor person that issues or sells such certificate or card disclose to a consumer any dormancy, inactivity, and service fees associated with the certificate or card before such certificate or card may be purchased. Depending on the context, a single disclosure that meets the clear and conspicuous requirements of both \u00a7\u00a7 1005.20(d)(2) and (c)(3) may be used to disclose a dormancy, inactivity, or service fee. For example, if the disclosures on a certificate or card, required by \u00a7 1005.20(d)(2), are visible to the consumer without having to remove packaging or other materials sold with the certificate or card, for a purchase made in person, the disclosures also meet the requirements of \u00a7 1005.20(c)(3). Otherwise, a dormancy, inactivity, or service fee may need to be disclosed multiple times to satisfy the requirements of \u00a7\u00a7 1005.20(d)(2) and (c)(3). For example, if the disclosures on a certificate or card, required by \u00a7 1005.20(d)(2), are obstructed by packaging sold with the certificate or card, for a purchase made in person, they also must be disclosed on the packaging sold with the certificate or card to meet the requirements of \u00a7 1005.20(c)(3).\r\n\r\n{20-d-Interp-3}\r\n3. *Relationship between \u00a7\u00a7 1005.20(d)(2), (e)(3), and (f)(2).* In addition to any disclosures required under \u00a7 1005.20(d)(2), any applicable disclosures under \u00a7\u00a7 1005.20(e)(3) and (f)(2) of this section must also be provided on the certificate or card.\r\n\r\n{20-d-Interp-4}\r\n4. *One fee per month.* Under \u00a7 1005.20(d)(3), no more than one dormancy, inactivity, or service fee may be imposed in any given calendar month. For example, if a dormancy fee is imposed on January 1, following a year of inactivity, and a consumer makes a balance inquiry on January 15, a balance inquiry fee may not be imposed at that time because a dormancy fee was already imposed earlier that month and a balance inquiry fee is a type of service fee. If, however, the dormancy fee could be imposed on January 1, following a year of inactivity, and the consumer makes a balance inquiry on the same date, the person assessing the fees may choose whether to impose the dormancy fee or the balance inquiry fee on January 1. The restriction in \u00a7 1005.20(d)(3) does not apply to any fee that is not a dormancy, inactivity, or service fee. For example, assume a service fee is imposed on a general-use prepaid card on January 1, following a year of inactivity. If a consumer cashes out the remaining funds by check on January 15, a cash-out fee, to the extent such cash-out fee is permitted under \u00a7 1005.20(e)(4), may be imposed at that time because a cash-out fee is not a dormancy, inactivity, or service fee.\r\n\r\n{20-d-Interp-5}\r\n5. *Accumulation of fees.* Section 1005.20(d) prohibits the accumulation of dormancy, inactivity, or service fees for previous periods into a single fee because such a practice would circumvent the limitation in \u00a7 1005.20(d)(3) that only one fee may be charged per month. For example, if a consumer purchases and activates a store gift card on January 1 but never uses the card, a monthly maintenance fee of $2.00 a month may not be accumulated such that a fee of $24 is imposed on January 1 the following year.\r\n\r\n{20-e-Interp}\r\n#### 20(e) Prohibition on Sale of Gift Certificates or Cards With Expiration Dates\r\n\r\n{20-e-Interp-1}\r\n1. *Reasonable opportunity.* Under \u00a7 1005.20(e)(1), no person may sell or issue a gift certificate, store gift card, or general-use prepaid card with an expiration date, unless there are policies and procedures in place to provide consumers with a reasonable opportunity to purchase a certificate or card with at least five years remaining until the certificate or card expiration date. Consumers are deemed to have a reasonable opportunity to purchase a certificate or card with at least five years remaining until the certificate or card expiration date if:\r\n\r\n{20-e-Interp-1-i}\r\ni. There are policies and procedures established to prevent the sale of a certificate or card unless the certificate or card expiration date is at least five years after the date the certificate or card was sold or initially issued to a consumer; or\r\n\r\n{20-e-Interp-1-ii}\r\nii. A certificate or card is available to consumers to purchase five years and six months before the certificate or card expiration date.\r\n\r\n{20-e-Interp-2}\r\n2. *Applicability to replacement certificates or cards.* Section 1005.20(e)(1) applies solely to the *purchase* of a certificate or card. Therefore, \u00a7 1005.20(e)(1) does not apply to the replacement of such certificates or cards. Certificates or cards issued as a replacement may bear a certificate or card expiration date of less than five years from the date of issuance of the replacement certificate or card. If the certificate or card expiration date for a replacement certificate or card is later than the date set forth in \u00a7 1005.20(e)(2)(i), then pursuant to \u00a7 1005.20(e)(2), the expiration date for the underlying funds at the time the replacement certificate or card is issued must be no earlier than the expiration date for the replacement certificate or card. For purposes of \u00a7 1005.20(e)(2), funds are not considered to be loaded to a store gift card or general-use prepaid card solely because a replacement card has been issued or activated for use.\r\n\r\n{20-e-Interp-3}\r\n3. *Disclosure of funds expiration - date not required.* Section 1005.20(e)(3)(i) does not require disclosure of the precise date the funds will expire. It is sufficient to disclose, for example, \u201cFunds expire 5 years from the date funds last loaded to the card.\u201d; \u201cFunds can be used 5 years from the date money was last added to the card.\u201d; or \u201cFunds do not expire.\u201d\r\n\r\n{20-e-Interp-4}\r\n4. *Disclosure not required if no expiration date.* If the certificate or card and underlying funds do not expire, the disclosure required by \u00a7 1005.20(e)(3)(i) need not be stated on the certificate or card. If the certificate or card and underlying funds expire at the same time, only one expiration date need be disclosed on the certificate or card.\r\n\r\n{20-e-Interp-5}\r\n5. *Reference to toll-free telephone number and Web site.* If a certificate or card does not expire, or if the underlying funds are not available after the certificate or card expires, the disclosure required by \u00a7 1005.20(e)(3)(ii) need not be stated on the certificate or card. *See, however,* \u00a7 1005.20(f)(2).\r\n\r\n{20-e-Interp-6}\r\n6. *Relationship to \u00a7 226.20(f)(2).* The same toll-free telephone number and Web site may be used to comply with \u00a7\u00a7 226.20(e)(3)(ii) and (f)(2). Neither a toll-free number nor a Web site must be maintained or disclosed if no fees are imposed in connection with a certificate or card, and the certificate or card and the underlying funds do not expire.\r\n\r\n{20-e-Interp-7}\r\n7. *Distinguishing between certificate or card expiration and funds expiration.* If applicable, a disclosure must be made on the certificate or card that notifies a consumer that the certificate or card expires, but the funds either do not expire or expire later than the certificate or card, and that the consumer may contact the issuer for a replacement card. The disclosure must be made with equal prominence and in close proximity to the certificate or card expiration date. The close proximity requirement does not apply to oral disclosures. In the case of a certificate or card, close proximity means that the disclosure must be on the same side as the certificate or card expiration date. For example, if the disclosure is the same type size and is located immediately next to or directly above or below the certificate or card expiration date, without any intervening text or graphical displays, the disclosures would be deemed to be equally prominent and in close proximity. The disclosure need not be embossed on the certificate or card to be deemed equally prominent, even if the expiration date is embossed on the certificate or card. The disclosure may state on the front of the card, for example, \u201cFunds expire after card. Call for replacement card.\u201d or \u201cFunds do not expire. Call for new card after 09/2016.\u201d Disclosures made pursuant to \u00a7 1005.20(e)(3)(iii)(A) may also fulfill the requirements of \u00a7 1005.20(e)(3)(i). For example, making a disclosure that \u201cFunds do not expire\u201d to comply with \u00a7 1005.20(e)(3)(iii)(A) also fulfills the requirements of \u00a7 1005.20(e)(3)(i).\r\n\r\n{20-e-Interp-8}\r\n8. *Expiration date safe harbor.* A non-reloadable certificate or card that bears an expiration date that is at least seven years from the date of manufacture need not state the disclosure required by \u00a7 1005.20(e)(3)(iii). However, \u00a7 1005.20(e)(1) still prohibits the sale or issuance of such certificate or card unless there are policies and procedures in place to provide a consumer with a reasonable opportunity to purchase the certificate or card with at least five years remaining until the certificate or card expiration date. In addition, under \u00a7 1005.20(e)(2), the funds may not expire before the certificate or card expiration date, even if the expiration date of the certificate or card bears an expiration date that is more than five years from the date of purchase. For purposes of this safe harbor, the date of manufacture is the date on which the certificate or card expiration date is printed on the certificate or card.\r\n\r\n{20-e-Interp-9}\r\n9. *Relationship between \u00a7\u00a7 1005.20(d)(2), (e)(3), and (f)(2).* In addition to any disclosures required to be made under \u00a7 1005.20(e)(3), any applicable disclosures under \u00a7\u00a7 1005.20(d)(2) and (f)(2) must also be provided on the certificate or card.\r\n\r\n{20-e-Interp-10}\r\n10. *Replacement or remaining balance of an expired certificate or card.* When a certificate or card expires, but the underlying funds have not expired, an issuer, at its option in accordance with applicable state law, may provide either a replacement certificate or card or otherwise provide the certificate or card holder, for example, by check, with the remaining balance on the certificate or card. In either case, the issuer may not charge a fee for the service.\r\n\r\n{20-e-Interp-11}\r\n11. *Replacement of a lost or stolen certificate or card not required.* Section 1005.20(e)(4) does not require the replacement of a certificate or card that has been lost or stolen.\r\n\r\n{20-e-Interp-12}\r\n12. *Date of issuance or loading.* For purposes of \u00a7 1005.20(e)(2)(i), a certificate or card is not issued or loaded with funds until the certificate or card is activated for use.\r\n\r\n{20-e-Interp-13}\r\n13. *Application of expiration date provisions after redemption of certificate or card.* The requirement that funds underlying a certificate or card must not expire for at least five years from the date of issuance or date of last load ceases to apply once the certificate or card has been fully redeemed, even if the underlying funds are not used to contemporaneously purchase a specific good or service. For example, some certificates or cards can be used to purchase music, media, or virtual goods. Once redeemed by a consumer, the entire balance on the certificate or card is debited from the certificate or card and credited or transferred to another \u201caccount\u201d established by the merchant of such goods or services. The consumer can then make purchases of songs, media, or virtual goods from the merchant using that \u201caccount\u201d either at the time the value is transferred from the certificate or card or at a later time. Under these circumstances, once the card has been fully redeemed and the \u201caccount\u201d credited with the amount of the underlying funds, the five-year minimum expiration term no longer applies to the underlying funds. However, if the consumer only partially redeems the value of the certificate or card, the five-year minimum expiration term requirement continues to apply to the funds remaining on the certificate or card.\r\n\r\n{20-f-Interp}\r\n#### 20(f) Additional Disclosure Requirements for Gift Certificates or Cards\r\n\r\n{20-f-Interp-1}\r\n1. *Reference to toll-free telephone number and Web site.* If a certificate or card does not have any fees, the disclosure under \u00a7 1005.20(f)(2) is not required on the certificate or card. *See, however,* \u00a7 1005.20(e)(3)(ii).\r\n\r\n{20-f-Interp-2}\r\n2. *Relationship to \u00a7 226.20(e)(3)(ii).* The same toll-free telephone number and Web site may be used to comply with \u00a7\u00a7 226.20(e)(3)(ii) and (f)(2). Neither a toll-free number nor a Web site must be maintained or disclosed if no fees are imposed in connection with a certificate or card, and both the certificate or card and underlying funds do not expire.\r\n\r\n{20-f-Interp-3}\r\n3. *Relationship between \u00a7\u00a7 1005.20(d)(2), (e)(3), and (f)(2).* In addition to any disclosures required pursuant to \u00a7 1005.20(f)(2), any applicable disclosures under \u00a7\u00a7 1005.20(d)(2) and (e)(3) must also be provided on the certificate or card.\r\n\r\n{20-g-Interp}\r\n#### 20(g) Compliance Dates\r\n\r\n{20-g-Interp-1}\r\n1. *Period of eligibility for loyalty, award, or promotional programs.* For purposes of \u00a7 1005.20(g)(2), the period of eligibility is the time period during which a consumer must engage in a certain action or actions to meet the terms of eligibility for a loyalty, award, or promotional program and obtain the card, code, or other device. Under \u00a7 1005.20(g)(2), a gift card issued pursuant to a loyalty, award, or promotional program that began prior to August 22, 2010 need not state the disclosures in \u00a7 1005.20(a)(4)(iii) regardless of whether the consumer became eligible to receive the gift card prior to August 22, 2010, or after that date. For example, a product manufacturer may provide a $20 rebate card to a consumer if the consumer purchases a particular product and submits a fully completed entry between January 1, 2010 and December 31, 2010. Similarly, a merchant may provide a $20 gift card to a consumer if the consumer makes $200 worth of qualifying purchases between June 1, 2010 and October 30, 2010. Under both examples, gift cards provided pursuant to these loyalty, award, or promotional programs need not state the disclosures in \u00a7 1005.20(a)(4)(iii) to qualify for the exclusion in \u00a7 1005.20(b)(3) for loyalty, award, or promotional gift cards because the period of eligibility for each program began prior to August 22, 2010.\r\n\r\n{20-h-Interp}\r\n#### 20(h) Temporary Exemption\r\n\r\n{20-h-1-Interp}\r\n#### 20(h)(1) Delayed Effective Date\r\n\r\n{20-h-1-Interp-1}\r\n1. *Application to certificates or cards produced prior to April 1, 2010.* Certificates or cards produced prior to April 1, 2010 may be sold to a consumer on or after August 22, 2010 without satisfying the requirements of \u00a7\u00a7 1005.20(c)(3), (d)(2), (e)(1), (e)(3), and (f) through January 30, 2011, provided that issuers of such certificates or cards comply with the additional substantive and disclosure requirements of \u00a7\u00a7 1005.20(h)(1)(i) through (iv). Issuers of certificates or cards produced prior to April 1, 2010 need not satisfy these additional requirements if the certificates or cards fully comply with the rule (\u00a7\u00a7 1005.20(a) through (f)). For example, the in-store signage and other disclosures required by \u00a7 1005.20(h)(2) do not apply to gift cards produced prior to April 1, 2010 that do not have fees and do not expire, and which otherwise comply with the rule.\r\n\r\n{20-h-1-Interp-2}\r\n2. *Expiration of temporary exemption.* Certificates or cards produced prior to April 1, 2010 that do not fully comply with \u00a7\u00a7 1005.20(a) through (f) may not be issued or sold to consumers on or after January 31, 2011.\r\n\r\n{20-h-2-Interp}\r\n#### 20(h)(2) Additional Disclosures\r\n\r\n{20-h-2-Interp-1}\r\n1. *Disclosures through third parties.* Issuers may make the disclosures required by \u00a7 1005.20(h)(2) through a third party, such as a retailer or merchant. For example, an issuer may have a merchant install in-store signage with the disclosures required by \u00a7 1005.20(h)(2) on the issuer's behalf.\r\n\r\n{20-h-2-Interp-2}\r\n2. *General advertising disclosures.* Section 1005.20(h)(2) does not impose an obligation on the issuer to advertise gift certificates, store gift cards, or general-use prepaid cards.\r\n",

        "contents": "{30-Interp}\r\n### Section 1005.30 - Remittance Transfer Definitions\r\n\r\n{30-Interp-1}\r\n1. *Applicability of definitions in subpart A.* Except as modified or limited by subpart B (which modifications or limitations apply only to subpart B), the definitions in \u00a7 1005.2 apply to all of Regulation E, including subpart B.\r\n\r\n{30-b-Interp}\r\n#### 30(b) Business Day\r\n\r\n{30-b-Interp-1}\r\n1. *General.* A business day, as defined in \u00a7 1005.30(b), includes the entire 24-hour period ending at midnight, and a notice given pursuant to any section of subpart B is effective even if given outside of normal business hours. A remittance transfer provider is not required under subpart B to make telephone lines available on a 24-hour basis.\r\n\r\n{30-b-Interp-2}\r\n2. *Substantially all business functions.* \u201cSubstantially all business functions\u201d include both the public and the back-office operations of the provider. For example, if the offices of a provider are open on Saturdays for customers to request remittance transfers, but not for performing internal functions (such as investigating errors), then Saturday is not a business day for that provider. In this case, Saturday does not count toward the business-day standard set by subpart B for resolving errors, processing refunds, etc.\r\n\r\n{30-b-Interp-3}\r\n3. *Short hours.* A provider may determine, at its election, whether an abbreviated day is a business day. For example, if a provider engages in substantially all business functions until noon on Saturdays instead of its usual 3 p.m. closing, it may consider Saturday a business day.\r\n\r\n{30-b-Interp-4}\r\n4. *Telephone line.* If a provider makes a telephone line available on Sundays for cancelling the transfer, but performs no other business functions, Sunday is not a business day under the \u201csubstantially all business functions\u201d standard.\r\n\r\n{30-c-Interp}\r\n#### 30(c) Designated Recipient\r\n\r\n{30-c-Interp-1}\r\n1. *Person.* A designated recipient can be either a natural person or an organization, such as a corporation. *See* \u00a7 1005.2(j) (definition of person). The designated recipient is identified by the name of the person provided by the sender to the remittance transfer provider and disclosed by the provider to the sender pursuant to \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1)(iii).\r\n\r\n{30-c-Interp-2}\r\n2. *Location in a foreign country.*\r\n\r\n{30-c-Interp-2-i}\r\ni. A remittance transfer is received at a location in a foreign country if funds are to be received at a location physically outside of any State, as defined in \u00a7 1005.2(l). A specific pick-up location need not be designated for funds to be received at a location in a foreign country. If it is specified that the funds will be transferred to a foreign country to be picked up by the designated recipient, the transfer will be received at a location in a foreign country, even though a specific pick-up location within that country has not been designated. If it is specified that the funds will be received at a location on a U.S. military installation that is physically located in a foreign country, the transfer will be received in a State.\r\n\r\n{30-c-Interp-2-ii}\r\nii. For transfers to a designated recipient's account, whether funds are to be received at a location physically outside of any State depends on where the recipient's account is located. If the account is located in a State, the funds will not be received at a location in a foreign country. Accounts that are located on a U.S. military installation that is physically located in a foreign country are located in a State.\r\n\r\n{30-c-Interp-2-iii}\r\niii. Where the sender does not specify information about a designated recipient's account, but instead provides information about the recipient, a remittance transfer provider may make the determination of whether the funds will be received at a location in a foreign country on information that is provided by the sender, and other information the provider may have, at the time the transfer is requested. For example, if a consumer in a State gives a provider the recipient's email address, and the provider has no other information about whether the funds will be received by the recipient at a location in a foreign country, then the provider may determine that funds are not to be received at a location in a foreign country. However, if the provider at the time the transfer is requested has additional information indicating that funds are to be received in a foreign country, such as if the recipient's email address is already registered with the provider and associated with a foreign account, then the provider has sufficient information to conclude that the remittance transfer will be received at a location in a foreign country. Similarly, if a consumer in a State purchases a prepaid card, and the provider mails or delivers the card directly to the consumer, the provider may conclude that funds are not to be received in a foreign country, because the provider does not know whether the consumer will subsequently send the prepaid card to a recipient in a foreign country. In contrast, the provider has sufficient information to conclude that the funds are to be received in a foreign country if the remittance transfer provider sends a prepaid card to a specified recipient in a foreign country, even if a person located in a State, including the sender, retains the ability to access funds on the prepaid card.\r\n\r\n{30-c-Interp-3}\r\n3. *Sender as designated recipient.* A \u201csender,\u201d as defined in \u00a7 1005.30(g), may also be a designated recipient if the sender meets the definition of \u201cdesignated recipient\u201d in \u00a7 1005.30(c). For example, a sender may request that a provider send an electronic transfer of funds from the sender's checking account in a State to the sender's checking account located in a foreign country. In this case, the sender would also be a designated recipient.\r\n\r\n{30-d-Interp}\r\n#### 30(d) Preauthorized Remittance Transfer\r\n\r\n{30-d-Interp-1}\r\n1. *Advance authorization.* A preauthorized remittance transfer is a remittance transfer authorized in advance of a transfer that will take place on a recurring basis, at substantially regular intervals, and will require no further action by the consumer to initiate the transfer. In a bill-payment system, for example, if the consumer authorizes a remittance transfer provider to make monthly payments to a payee by means of a remittance transfer, and the payments take place without further action by the consumer, the payments are preauthorized remittance transfers. In contrast, if the consumer must take action each month to initiate a transfer (such as by entering instructions on a telephone or home computer), the payments are not preauthorized remittance transfers.\r\n\r\n{30-e-Interp}\r\n#### 30(e) Remittance Transfer\r\n\r\n{30-e-Interp-1}\r\n1. *Electronic transfer of funds.* The definition of \u201cremittance transfer\u201d requires an electronic transfer of funds. The term electronic has the meaning given in section 106(2) of the Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act. There may be an electronic transfer of funds if a provider makes an electronic book entry between different settlement accounts to effectuate the transfer. However, where a sender mails funds directly to a recipient, or provides funds to a courier for delivery to a foreign country, there is not an electronic transfer of funds. Similarly, generally, where a provider issues a check, draft, or other paper instrument to be mailed to a person abroad, there is not an electronic transfer of funds. Nonetheless, an electronic transfer of funds occurs for a payment made by a provider under a bill-payment service available to a consumer via computer or other electronic means, unless the terms of the bill-payment service explicitly state that all payments, or all payments to a particular payee or payees, will be solely by check, draft, or similar paper instrument drawn on the consumer's account to be mailed abroad, and the payee or payees that will be paid in this manner are identified to the consumer. With respect to such a bill-payment service, if a provider provides a check, draft or similar paper instrument drawn on a consumer's account to be mailed abroad for a payee that is not identified to the consumer as described above, this payment by check, draft or similar payment instrument will be an electronic transfer of funds.\r\n\r\n{30-e-Interp-2}\r\n2. *Sent by a remittance transfer provider.*\r\n\r\n{30-e-Interp-2-i}\r\ni. The definition of \u201cremittance transfer\u201d requires that a transfer be \u201csent by a remittance transfer provider.\u201d This means that there must be an intermediary that is directly engaged with the sender to send an electronic transfer of funds on behalf of the sender to a designated recipient.\r\n\r\n{30-e-Interp-2-ii}\r\nii. A payment card network or other third party payment service that is functionally similar to a payment card network does not send a remittance transfer when a consumer provides a debit, credit or prepaid card directly to a foreign merchant as payment for goods or services. In such a case, the payment card network or third party payment service is not directly engaged with the sender to send a transfer of funds to a person in a foreign country; rather, the network or third party payment service is merely providing contemporaneous third-party payment processing and settlement services on behalf of the merchant or the card issuer, rather than on behalf of the sender. In such a case, the card issuer also is not directly engaged with the sender to send an electronic transfer of funds to the foreign merchant when the card issuer provides payment to the merchant. Similarly, where a consumer provides a checking or other account number, or a debit, credit or prepaid card, directly to a foreign merchant as payment for goods or services, the merchant is not acting as an intermediary that sends a transfer of funds on behalf of the sender when it submits the payment information for processing.\r\n\r\n{30-e-Interp-2-iii}\r\niii. However, a card issuer or a payment network may offer a service to a sender where the card issuer or a payment network is an intermediary that is directly engaged with the sender to obtain funds using the sender's debit, prepaid or credit card and to send those funds to a recipient's checking account located in a foreign country. In this case, the card issuer or the payment network is an intermediary that is directly engaged with the sender to send an electronic transfer of funds on behalf of the sender, and this transfer of funds is a remittance transfer because it is made to a designated recipient. *See* comment 30(c)-2.ii.\r\n\r\n{30-e-Interp-3}\r\n3. *Examples of remittance transfers.*\r\n\r\n{30-e-Interp-3-i}\r\ni. Examples of remittance transfers include:\r\n\r\n{30-e-Interp-3-i-A}\r\nA. Transfers where the sender provides cash or another method of payment to a money transmitter or financial institution and requests that funds be sent to a specified location or account in a foreign country.\r\n\r\n{30-e-Interp-3-i-B}\r\nB. Consumer wire transfers, where a financial institution executes a payment order upon a sender's request to wire money from the sender's account to a designated recipient.\r\n\r\n{30-e-Interp-3-i-C}\r\nC. An addition of funds to a prepaid card by a participant in a prepaid card program, such as a prepaid card issuer or its agent, that is directly engaged with the sender to add these funds, where the prepaid card is sent or was previously sent by a participant in the prepaid card program to a person in a foreign country, even if a person located in a State (including a sender) retains the ability to withdraw such funds.\r\n\r\n{30-e-Interp-3-i-D}\r\nD. International ACH transactions sent by the sender's financial institution at the sender's request.\r\n\r\n{30-e-Interp-3-i-E}\r\nE. Online bill payments and other electronic transfers that a sender schedules in advance, including preauthorized remittance transfers, made by the sender's financial institution at the sender's request to a designated recipient.\r\n\r\n{30-e-Interp-3-ii}\r\nii. The term remittance transfer does not include, for example:\r\n\r\n{30-e-Interp-3-ii-A}\r\nA. A consumer's provision of a debit, credit or prepaid card, directly to a foreign merchant as payment for goods or services because the issuer is not directly engaged with the sender to send an electronic transfer of funds to the foreign merchant when the issuer provides payment to the merchant. *See* comment 30(e)-2.\r\n\r\n{30-e-Interp-3-ii-B}\r\nB. A consumer's deposit of funds to a checking or savings account located in a State, because there has not been a transfer of funds to a designated recipient. *See* comment 30(c)-2.ii.\r\n\r\n{30-e-Interp-3-ii-C}\r\nC. Online bill payments and other electronic transfers that senders can schedule in advance, including preauthorized transfers, made through the Web site of a merchant located in a foreign country and via direct provision of a checking account, credit card, debit card or prepaid card number to the merchant, because the financial institution is not directly engaged with the sender to send an electronic transfer of funds to the foreign merchant when the institution provides payment to the merchant. *See* comment 30(e)-2.\r\n\r\n{30-f-Interp}\r\n#### 30(f) Remittance Transfer Provider\r\n\r\n{30-f-Interp-1}\r\n1. *Agents.* A person is not deemed to be acting as a remittance transfer provider when it performs activities as an agent on behalf of a remittance transfer provider.\r\n\r\n{30-f-Interp-2}\r\n2. *Normal course of business.*\r\n\r\n{30-f-Interp-2-i}\r\ni. *General.* Whether a person provides remittance transfers in the normal course of business depends on the facts and circumstances, including the total number and frequency of remittance transfers sent by the provider. For example, if a financial institution generally does not make remittance transfers available to customers, but sends a couple of such transfers in a given year as an accommodation for a customer, the institution does not provide remittance transfers in the normal course of business. In contrast, if a financial institution makes remittance transfers generally available to customers (whether described in the institution's deposit account agreement, or in practice) and makes transfers many times per month, the institution provides remittance transfers in the normal course of business.\r\n\r\n{30-f-Interp-2-ii}\r\nii. *Safe harbor.* Under \u00a7 1005.30(f)(2)(i), a person that provided 100 or fewer remittance transfers in the previous calendar year and provides 100 or fewer remittance transfers in the current calendar year is deemed not to be providing remittance transfers in the normal course of its business. Accordingly, a person that qualifies for the safe harbor in \u00a7 1005.30(f)(2)(i) is not a \u201cremittance transfer provider\u201d and is not subject to the requirements of subpart B. For purposes of determining whether a person qualifies for the safe harbor under \u00a7 1005.30(f)(2)(i), the number of remittance transfers provided includes any transfers excluded from the definition of \u201cremittance transfer\u201d due simply to the safe harbor. In contrast, the number of remittance transfers provided does not include any transfers that are excluded from the definition of \u201cremittance transfer\u201d for reasons other than the safe harbor, such as small value transactions or securities and commodities transfers that are excluded from the definition of \u201cremittance transfer\u201d by \u00a7 1005.30(e)(2).\r\n\r\n{30-f-Interp-2-iii}\r\niii. *Transition period.* A person may cease to satisfy the requirements of the safe harbor described in \u00a7 1005.30(f)(2)(i) if the person provides in excess of 100 remittance transfers in a calendar year. For example, if a person that provided 100 or fewer remittance transfers in the previous calendar year provides more than 100 remittance transfers in the current calendar year, the safe harbor applies to the first 100 remittance transfers that the person provides in the current calendar year. For any additional remittance transfers provided in the current calendar year and for any remittance transfers provided in the subsequent calendar year, whether the person provides remittance transfers for a consumer in the normal course of its business, as defined in \u00a7 1005.30(f)(1), and is thus a remittance transfer provider for those additional transfers, depends on the facts and circumstances. Section 1005.30(f)(2)(ii) provides a reasonable period of time, not to exceed six months, for such a person to begin complying with subpart B, if that person is then providing remittance transfers in the normal course of its business. At the end of that reasonable period of time, such person would be required to comply with subpart B unless, based on the facts and circumstances, the person is not a remittance transfer provider.\r\n\r\n{30-f-Interp-2-iv}\r\niv. *Example of safe harbor and transition period.* Assume that a person provided 90 remittance transfers in 2012 and 90 such transfers in 2013. The safe harbor will apply to the person's transfers in 2013, as well as the person's first 100 remittance transfers in 2014. However, if the person provides a 101st transfer on September 5, the facts and circumstances determine whether the person provides remittance transfers in the normal course of business and is thus a remittance transfer provider for the 101st and any subsequent remittance transfers that it provides in 2014. Furthermore, the person would not qualify for the safe harbor described in \u00a7 1005.30(f)(2)(i) in 2015 because the person did not provide 100 or fewer remittance transfers in 2014. However, for the 101st remittance transfer provided in 2014, as well as additional remittance transfers provided thereafter in 2014 and 2015, if that person is then providing remittance transfers for a consumer in the normal course of business, the person will have a reasonable period of time, not to exceed six months, to come into compliance with subpart B. Assume that in this case, a reasonable period of time is six months. Thus, compliance with subpart B is not required for remittance transfers made on or before March 5, 2015 ( *i.e.,* six months after September 5, 2014). After March 5, 2015, the person is required to comply with subpart B if, based on the facts and circumstances, the person provides remittance transfers in the normal course of business and is thus a remittance transfer provider.\r\n\r\n{30-f-Interp-3}\r\n3. *Multiple remittance transfer providers.* If the remittance transfer involves more than one remittance transfer provider, only one set of disclosures must be given, and the remittance transfer providers must agree among themselves which provider must take the actions necessary to comply with the requirements that subpart B imposes on any or all of them. Even though the providers must designate one provider to take the actions necessary to comply with the requirements that subpart B imposes on any or all of them, all remittance transfer providers involved in the remittance transfer remain responsible for compliance with the applicable provisions of the EFTA and Regulation E.\r\n\r\n{30-g-Interp}\r\n#### 30(g) Sender\r\n\r\n{30-g-Interp-1}\r\n1. *Determining whether a consumer is located in a State.* Under \u00a7 1005.30(g), the definition of \u201csender\u201d means a consumer in a State who, primarily for personal, family, or household purposes, requests a remittance transfer provider to send a remittance transfer to a designated recipient. A sender located on a U.S. military installation that is physically located in a foreign country is located in a State. For transfers from a consumer's account, whether a consumer is located in a State depends on where the consumer's account is located. If the account is located in a State, the consumer will be located in a State for purposes of the definition of \u201csender\u201d in \u00a7 1005.30(g), notwithstanding comment 3(a)-3. Accounts that are located on a U.S. military installation that is physically located in a foreign country are located in a State. Where a transfer is requested electronically or by telephone and the transfer is not from an account, the provider may make the determination of whether a consumer is located in a State based on information that is provided by the consumer and on any records associated with the consumer that the provider may have, such as an address provided by the consumer.\r\n\r\n{30-g-Interp-2}\r\n2. *Personal, family, or household purposes.* Under \u00a7 1005.30(g), a consumer is a \u201csender\u201d only where he or she requests a transfer primarily for personal, family, or household purposes. A consumer who requests a transfer primarily for other purposes, such as business or commercial purposes, is not a sender under \u00a7 1005.30(g). For transfers from an account that was established primarily for personal, family, or household purposes, a remittance transfer provider may generally deem that the transfer is requested primarily for personal, family, or household purposes and the consumer is therefore a \u201csender\u201d under \u00a7 1005.30(g). But if the consumer indicates that he or she is requesting the transfer primarily for other purposes, such as business or commercial purposes, then the consumer is not a sender under \u00a7 1005.30(g), even if the consumer is requesting the transfer from an account that is used primarily for personal, family, or household purposes.\r\n\r\n{30-g-Interp-3}\r\n3. *Non-consumer accounts.* A provider may deem that a transfer that is requested to be sent from an account that was not established primarily for personal, family, or household purposes, such as an account that was established as a business or commercial account or an account held by a business entity such as a corporation, not-for-profit corporation, professional corporation, limited liability company, partnership, or sole proprietorship, as not being requested primarily for personal, family, or household purposes. A consumer requesting a transfer from such an account therefore is not a sender under \u00a7 1005.30(g). Additionally, a transfer that is requested to be sent from an account held by a financial institution under a *bona fide* trust agreement pursuant to \u00a7 1005.2(b)(3) is not requested primarily for personal, family, or household purposes, and a consumer requesting a transfer from such an account is therefore not a sender under \u00a7 1005.30(g).\r\n\r\n{30-h-Interp}\r\n#### 30(h) Third-Party Fees\r\n\r\n{30-h-Interp-1}\r\n1. *Fees imposed on the remittance transfer.* Fees imposed on the remittance transfer by a person other than the remittance transfer provider include only those fees that are charged to the designated recipient and are specifically related to the remittance transfer. For example, overdraft fees that are imposed by a recipient's bank or funds that are garnished from the proceeds of a remittance transfer to satisfy an unrelated debt are not fees imposed on the remittance transfer because these charges are not specifically related to the remittance transfer. Account fees are also not specifically related to a remittance transfer if such fees are merely assessed based on general account activity and not for receiving transfers. Where an incoming remittance transfer results in a balance increase that triggers a monthly maintenance fee, that fee is not specifically related to a remittance transfer. Similarly, fees that banks charge one another for handling a remittance transfer or other fees that do not affect the total amount of the transaction or the amount that will be received by the designated recipient are not fees imposed on the remittance transfer. For example, an interchange fee that is charged to a provider when a sender uses a credit or debit card to pay for a remittance transfer is not a fee imposed upon the remittance transfer. Fees that specifically relate to a remittance transfer may be structured on a flat per-transaction basis, or may be conditioned on other factors (such as account status or the quantity of remittance transfers received) in addition to the remittance transfer itself. For example, where an institution charges an incoming transfer fee on most customers' accounts, but not on preferred accounts, such a fee is nonetheless specifically related to a remittance transfer. Similarly, if the institution assesses a fee for every transfer beyond the fifth received each month, such a fee would be specifically related to the remittance transfer regardless of how many remittance transfers preceded it that month.\r\n\r\n{30-h-Interp-2}\r\n2. *Covered third-party fees.*\r\n\r\n{30-h-Interp-2-i}\r\ni. Under \u00a7 1005.30(h)(1), a covered third-party fee means any fee that is imposed on the remittance transfer by a person other than the remittance transfer provider that is not a non-covered third-party fee.\r\n\r\n{30-h-Interp-2-ii}\r\nii. Examples of covered third-party fees include:\r\n\r\n{30-h-Interp-2-ii-A}\r\nA. Fees imposed on a remittance transfer by intermediary institutions in connection with a wire transfer (sometimes referred to as \u201clifting fees\u201d).\r\n\r\n{30-h-Interp-2-ii-B}\r\nB. Fees imposed on a remittance transfer by an agent of the provider at pick-up for receiving the transfer.\r\n\r\n{30-h-Interp-2-ii-3}\r\n3. *Non-covered third-party fees.* Under \u00a7 1005.30(h)(2), a non-covered third-party fee means any fee imposed by the designated recipient's institution for receiving a remittance transfer into an account except if such institution acts as the agent of the remittance transfer provider. For example, a fee imposed by the designated recipient's institution for receiving an incoming transfer into an account is a non-covered third-party fee, provided such institution is not acting as the agent of the remittance transfer provider. *See also* comment 31(b)(1)(viii)-1. Furthermore, designated recipient's account in \u00a7 1005.30(h)(2) refers to an asset account, regardless of whether it is a consumer asset account, established for any purpose and held by a bank, savings association, credit union, or equivalent institution. A designated recipient's account does not, however, include a credit card, prepaid card, or a virtual account held by an Internet-based or mobile telephone company that is not a bank, savings association, credit union or equivalent institution.\r\n",

        "contents": "{31-Interp}\r\n### Section 1005.31 - Disclosures\r\n\r\n{31-a-Interp}\r\n#### 31(a) General Form of Disclosures\r\n\r\n{31-a-1-Interp}\r\n#### 31(a)(1) Clear and Conspicuous\r\n\r\n{31-a-1-Interp-1}\r\n1. *Clear and conspicuous standard.* Disclosures are clear and conspicuous for purposes of subpart B if they are readily understandable and, in the case of written and electronic disclosures, the location and type size are readily noticeable to senders. Oral disclosures as permitted by \u00a7 1005.31(a)(3), (4), and (5) are clear and conspicuous when they are given at a volume and speed sufficient for a sender to hear and comprehend them.\r\n\r\n{31-a-1-Interp-2}\r\n2. *Abbreviations and symbols.* Disclosures may contain commonly accepted or readily understandable abbreviations or symbols, such as \u201cUSD\u201d to indicate currency in U.S. dollars or \u201cMXN\u201d to indicate currency in Mexican pesos.\r\n\r\n{31-a-2-Interp}\r\n#### 31(a)(2) Written and Electronic Disclosures\r\n\r\n{31-a-2-Interp-1}\r\n1. *E-Sign Act requirements.* If a sender electronically requests the remittance transfer provider to send a remittance transfer, the disclosures required by \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1) may be provided to the sender in electronic form without regard to the consumer consent and other applicable provisions of the Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act (E-Sign Act) (15 U.S.C. 7001 *et seq.*). If a sender electronically requests the provider to send a remittance transfer, the disclosures required by \u00a7 1005.31(b)(2) may be provided to the sender in electronic form, subject to compliance with the consumer consent and other applicable provisions of the E-Sign Act. *See* \u00a7 1005.4(a)(1).\r\n\r\n{31-a-2-Interp-2}\r\n2. *Paper size.* Written disclosures may be provided on any size paper, as long as the disclosures are clear and conspicuous. For example, disclosures may be provided on a register receipt or on an 8.5 inch by 11 inch sheet of paper.\r\n\r\n{31-a-2-Interp-3}\r\n3. *Retainable electronic disclosures.* A remittance transfer provider may satisfy the requirement to provide electronic disclosures in a retainable form if it provides an online disclosure in a format that is capable of being printed. Electronic disclosures may not be provided through a hyperlink or in another manner by which the sender can bypass the disclosure. A provider is not required to confirm that the sender has read the electronic disclosures.\r\n\r\n{31-a-2-Interp-4}\r\n4. *Pre-payment disclosures to a mobile telephone.* Disclosures provided via mobile application or text message, to the extent permitted by \u00a7 1005.31(a)(5), need not be retainable. However, disclosures provided electronically to a mobile telephone that are not provided via mobile application or text message must be retainable. For example, disclosures provided via email must be retainable, even if a sender accesses them by mobile telephone.\r\n\r\n{31-a-2-Interp-5}\r\n5. *Disclosures provided by fax.* For purposes of disclosures required to be provided pursuant to \u00a7 1005.31 or \u00a7 1005.36, disclosures provided by facsimile transmission ( *i.e.,* fax) are considered to be provided in writing for purposes of providing disclosures in writing pursuant to subpart B and are not subject to the requirements for electronic disclosures set forth in \u00a7 1005.31(a)(2).\r\n\r\n{31-a-3-Interp}\r\n#### 31(a)(3) Disclosures for Oral Telephone Transactions\r\n\r\n{31-a-3-Interp-1}\r\n1. *Transactions conducted partially by telephone.* Except as provided in comment 31(a)(3)-2, for transactions conducted partially by telephone, providing the information required by \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1) to a sender orally does not fulfill the requirement to provide the disclosures required by \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1). For example, a sender may begin a remittance transfer at a remittance transfer provider's dedicated telephone in a retail store, and then provide payment in person to a store clerk to complete the transaction. In such cases, all disclosures must be provided in writing. A provider complies with this requirement, for example, by providing the written pre-payment disclosure in person prior to the sender's payment for the transaction, and the written receipt when the sender pays for the transaction.\r\n\r\n{31-a-3-Interp-2}\r\n2. *Oral telephone transactions.* Section 1005.31(a)(3) applies to transactions conducted orally and entirely by telephone, such as transactions conducted orally on a landline or mobile telephone. A remittance transfer provider may treat a written or electronic communication as an inquiry when it believes that treating the communication as a request would be impractical. For example, if a sender physically located abroad contacts a U.S. branch of the sender's financial institution and attempts to initiate a remittance transfer by first sending a mailed letter, further communication with the sender by letter may be impractical due to the physical distance and likely mail delays. In such circumstances, a provider may conduct the transaction orally and entirely by telephone pursuant to \u00a7 1005.31(a)(3) when the provider treats that initial communication as an inquiry and subsequently responds to the consumer's inquiry by calling the consumer on a telephone and orally gathering or confirming the information needed to identify and understand a request for a remittance transfer and otherwise conducts the transaction orally and entirely by telephone.\r\n\r\n{31-a-5-Interp}\r\n#### 31(a)(5) Disclosures for Mobile Application or Text Message Transactions\r\n\r\n{31-a-5-Interp-1}\r\n1. *Mobile application and text message transactions.* A remittance transfer provider may provide the required pre-payment disclosures orally or via mobile application or text message if the transaction is conducted entirely by telephone via mobile application or text message, the remittance transfer provider complies with the requirements of \u00a7 1005.31(g)(2), and the provider discloses orally or via mobile application or text message a statement about the rights of the sender regarding cancellation required by \u00a7 1005.31(b)(2)(iv) pursuant to the timing requirements in \u00a7 1005.31(e)(1). For example, if a sender conducts a transaction via text message on a mobile telephone, the remittance transfer provider may call the sender and orally provide the required pre-payment disclosures. Alternatively, the provider may provide the required pre-payment disclosures via text message. Section 1005.31(a)(5) applies only to transactions conducted entirely by mobile telephone via mobile application or text message.\r\n\r\n{31-b-Interp}\r\n#### 31(b) Disclosure Requirements\r\n\r\n{31-b-Interp-1}\r\n1. *Disclosures provided as applicable.* Disclosures required by \u00a7 1005.31(b) need only be provided to the extent applicable. A remittance transfer provider may choose to omit an item of information required by \u00a7 1005.31(b) if it is inapplicable to a particular transaction. Alternatively, for disclosures required by \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1)(i) through (vii), a provider may disclose a term and state that an amount or item is \u201cnot applicable,\u201d \u201cN/A,\u201d or \u201cNone.\u201d For example, if fees or taxes are not imposed in connection with a particular transaction, the provider need not provide the disclosures about fees and taxes generally required by \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1)(ii), the disclosures about covered third-party fees generally required by \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1)(vi), or the disclaimers about non-covered third-party fees and taxes collected by a person other than the provider generally required by \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1)(viii). Similarly, a Web site need not be disclosed if the provider does not maintain a Web site. A provider need not provide the exchange rate disclosure required by \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1)(iv) if a recipient receives funds in the currency in which the remittance transfer is funded, or if funds are delivered into an account denominated in the currency in which the remittance transfer is funded. For example, if a sender in the United States sends funds from an account denominated in Euros to an account in France denominated in Euros, no exchange rate would need to be provided. Similarly, if a sender funds a remittance transfer in U.S. dollars and requests that a remittance transfer be delivered to the recipient in U.S. dollars, a provider need not disclose an exchange rate.\r\n\r\n{31-b-Interp-2}\r\n2. *Substantially similar terms, language, and notices.* Certain disclosures required by \u00a7 1005.31(b) must be described using the terms set forth in \u00a7 1005.31(b) or substantially similar terms. Terms may be more specific than those provided. For example, a remittance transfer provider sending funds may describe fees imposed by an agent at pick-up as \u201cPick-up Fees\u201d in lieu of describing them as \u201cOther Fees.\u201d Foreign language disclosures required under \u00a7 1005.31(g) must contain accurate translations of the terms, language, and notices required by \u00a7 1005.31(b) or permitted by \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1)(viii) and \u00a7 1005.33(h)(3).\r\n\r\n{31-b-1-Interp}\r\n#### 31(b)(1) Pre-Payment Disclosures\r\n\r\n{31-b-1-Interp-1}\r\n1. *Fees and taxes.*\r\n\r\n{31-b-1-Interp-1-i}\r\ni. Taxes collected on the remittance transfer by the remittance transfer provider include taxes collected on the remittance transfer by a State or other governmental body. A provider need only disclose fees imposed or taxes collected on the remittance transfer by the provider in \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1)(ii), as applicable. For example, if no transfer taxes are imposed on a remittance transfer, a provider would only disclose applicable transfer fees. *See* comment 31(b)-1. If both fees and taxes are imposed, the fees and taxes must be disclosed as separate, itemized disclosures. For example, a provider would disclose all transfer fees using the term \u201cTransfer Fees\u201d or a substantially similar term and would separately disclose all transfer taxes using the term \u201cTransfer Taxes\u201d or a substantially similar term.\r\n\r\n{31-b-1-Interp-1-ii}\r\nii. The fees and taxes required to be disclosed by \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1)(ii) include all fees imposed and all taxes collected on the remittance transfer by the provider. For example, a provider must disclose any service fee, any fees imposed by an agent of the provider at the time of the transfer, and any State taxes collected on the remittance transfer at the time of the transfer. Fees imposed on the remittance transfer by the provider required to be disclosed under \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1)(ii) include only those fees that are charged to the sender and are specifically related to the remittance transfer. *See also* comment 30(h)-1. In contrast, the fees required to be disclosed by \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1)(vi) are any covered third-party fees as defined in \u00a7 1005.30(h)(1).\r\n\r\n{31-b-1-Interp-1-iii}\r\niii. The term used to describe the fees imposed on the remittance transfer by the provider in \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1)(ii) and the term used to describe covered third-party fees under \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1)(vi) must differentiate between such fees. For example the terms used to describe fees disclosed under \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1)(ii) and (vi) may not both be described solely as \u201cFees.\u201d\r\n\r\n{31-b-1-Interp-2}\r\n2. *Transfer amount.* Sections 1005.31(b)(1)(i) and (v) require two transfer amount disclosures. First, under \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1)(i), a provider must disclose the transfer amount in the currency in which the remittance transfer is funded to show the calculation of the total amount of the transaction. Typically, the remittance transfer is funded in U.S. dollars, so the transfer amount would be expressed in U.S. dollars. However, if the remittance transfer is funded, for example, from a Euro-denominated account, the transfer amount would be expressed in Euros. Second, under \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1)(v), a provider must disclose the transfer amount in the currency in which the funds will be made available to the designated recipient. For example, if the funds will be picked up by the designated recipient in Japanese yen, the transfer amount would be expressed in Japanese yen. However, this second transfer amount need not be disclosed if covered third-party fees as described under \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1)(vi) are not imposed on the remittance transfer. The terms used to describe each transfer amount should be the same.\r\n\r\n{31-b-1-Interp-3}\r\n3. *Exchange rate for calculation.* The exchange rate used to calculate the transfer amount in \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1)(v), the covered third-party fees in \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1)(vi), the amount received in \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1)(vii), and the optional disclosures of non-covered third-party fees and other taxes permitted by \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1)(viii) is the exchange rate in \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1)(iv), including an estimated exchange rate to the extent permitted by \u00a7 1005.32, prior to any rounding of the exchange rate. For example, if one U.S. dollar exchanges for 11.9483779 Mexican pesos, a provider must calculate these disclosures using this rate, even though the provider may disclose pursuant to \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1)(iv) that the U.S. dollar exchanges for 11.9484 Mexican pesos. Similarly, if a provider estimates pursuant to \u00a7 1005.32 that one U.S. dollar exchanges for 11.9483 Mexican pesos, a provider must calculate these disclosures using this rate, even though the provider may disclose pursuant to \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1)(iv) that the U.S. dollar exchanges for 11.95 Mexican pesos (Estimated). If an exchange rate need not be rounded, a provider must use that exchange rate to calculate these disclosures. For example, if one U.S. dollar exchanges for exactly 11.9 Mexican pesos, a provider must calculate these disclosures using this exchange rate.\r\n\r\n{31-b-1-iv-Interp}\r\n#### 31(b)(1)(iv) Exchange Rate\r\n\r\n{31-b-1-iv-Interp-1}\r\n1. *Applicable exchange rate.* If the designated recipient will receive funds in a currency other than the currency in which the remittance transfer is funded, a remittance transfer provider must disclose the exchange rate to be used by the provider for the remittance transfer. An exchange rate that is estimated must be disclosed pursuant to the requirements of \u00a7 1005.32. A remittance transfer provider may not disclose, for example, that an exchange rate is \u201cunknown,\u201d \u201cfloating,\u201d or \u201cto be determined.\u201d If a provider does not have specific knowledge regarding the currency in which the funds will be received, the provider may rely on a sender's representation as to the currency in which funds will be received for purposes of determining whether an exchange rate is applied to the transfer. For example, if a sender requests that a remittance transfer be deposited into an account in U.S. dollars, the provider need not disclose an exchange rate, even if the account is actually denominated in Mexican pesos and the funds are converted prior to deposit into the account. If a sender does not know the currency in which funds will be received, the provider may assume that the currency in which funds will be received is the currency in which the remittance transfer is funded.\r\n\r\n{31-b-1-iv-Interp-2}\r\n2. *Rounding.* The exchange rate disclosed by the provider for the remittance transfer is required to be rounded. The provider may round to two, three, or four decimal places, at its option. For example, if one U.S. dollar exchanges for 11.9483779 Mexican pesos, a provider may disclose that the U.S. dollar exchanges for 11.9484 Mexican pesos. The provider may alternatively disclose, for example, that the U.S. dollar exchanges for 11.948 pesos or 11.95 pesos. On the other hand, if one U.S. dollar exchanges for exactly 11.9 Mexican pesos, the provider may disclose that \u201cUS$1 = 11.9 MXN\u201d in lieu of, for example, \u201cUS$1 = 11.90 MXN.\u201d The exchange rate disclosed for the remittance transfer must be rounded consistently for each currency. For example, a provider may not round to two decimal places for some transactions exchanged into Euros and round to four decimal places for other transactions exchanged into Euros.\r\n\r\n{31-b-1-iv-Interp-3}\r\n3. *Exchange rate used.* The exchange rate used by the provider for the remittance transfer need not be set by that provider. For example, an exchange rate set by an intermediary institution and applied to the remittance transfer would be the exchange rate used for the remittance transfer and must be disclosed by the provider.\r\n\r\n{31-b-1-vi-Interp}\r\n#### 31(b)(1)(vi) Disclosure of Covered Third-Party Fees\r\n\r\n{31-b-1-vi-Interp-1}\r\n1. *Fees disclosed in the currency in which the funds will be received.* Section 1005.31(b)(1)(vi) requires the disclosure of covered third-party fees in the currency in which the funds will be received by the designated recipient. A covered third-party fee described in \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1)(vi) may be imposed in one currency, but the funds may be received by the designated recipient in another currency. In such cases, the remittance transfer provider must calculate the fee to be disclosed under \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1)(vi) in the currency of receipt using the exchange rate in \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1)(iv), including an estimated exchange rate to the extent permitted by \u00a7 1005.32, prior to any rounding of the exchange rate. For example, an intermediary institution involved in sending an international wire transfer funded in U.S. dollars may impose a fee in U.S. dollars, but funds are ultimately deposited in the recipient's account in Euros. In this case, the provider would disclose the covered third-party fee to the sender expressed in Euros, calculated using the exchange rate disclosed under \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1)(iv), prior to any rounding of the exchange rate. For purposes of \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1)(v), (vi), and (vii), if a provider does not have specific knowledge regarding the currency in which the funds will be received, the provider may rely on a sender's representation as to the currency in which funds will be received. For example, if a sender requests that a remittance transfer be deposited into an account in U.S. dollars, the provider may provide the disclosures required in \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1)(v), (vi), and (vii) in U.S. dollars, even if the account is actually denominated in Mexican pesos and the funds are subsequently converted prior to deposit into the account. If a sender does not know the currency in which funds will be received, the provider may assume that the currency in which funds will be received is the currency in which the remittance transfer is funded.\r\n\r\n{31-b-1-vii-Interp}\r\n#### 31(b)(1)(vii) Amount Received\r\n\r\n{31-b-1-vii-Interp-1}\r\n *1. Amount received.* The remittance transfer provider is required to disclose the amount that will be received by the designated recipient in the currency in which the funds will be received. The amount received must reflect the exchange rate, all fees imposed and all taxes collected on the remittance transfer by the remittance transfer provider, as well as any covered third-party fees required to be disclosed by \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1)(vi). The disclosed amount received must be reduced by the amount of any fee or tax - except for a non-covered third-party fee or tax collected on the remittance transfer by a person other than the provider - that is imposed on the remittance transfer that affects the amount received even if that amount is imposed or itemized separately from the transaction amount.\r\n\r\n{31-b-1-viii-Interp}\r\n#### 31(b)(1)(viii) Statement When Additional Fees and Taxes May Apply\r\n\r\n{31-b-1-viii-Interp-1}\r\n1. *Required disclaimer when non-covered third-party fees and taxes collected by a person other than the provider may apply.* If non-covered third-party fees or taxes collected by a person other than the provider apply to a particular remittance transfer or if a provider does not know if such fees or taxes may apply to a particular remittance transfer, \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1)(viii) requires the provider to include the disclaimer with respect to such fees and taxes. Required disclosures under \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1)(viii) may only be provided to the extent applicable. For example, if the designated recipient's institution is an agent of the provider and thus, non-covered third-party fees cannot apply to the transfer, the provider must disclose all fees imposed on the remittance transfer and may not provide the disclaimer regarding non-covered third-party fees. In this scenario, the provider may only provide the disclaimer regarding taxes collected on the remittance transfer by a person other than the provider, as applicable. *See* Model Form A-30(c).\r\n\r\n{31-b-1-viii-Interp-2}\r\n2. *Optional disclosure of non-covered third-party fees and taxes collected by a person other than the provider.* When a remittance transfer provider knows the non-covered third-party fees or taxes collected on the remittance transfer by a person other than the provider that will apply to a particular transaction, \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1)(viii) permits the provider to disclose the amount of such fees and taxes. Section 1005.32(b)(3)-1 additionally permits a provider to disclose an estimate of such fees and taxes, provided any estimates are based on reasonable source of information. *See* comment 32(b)(3). For example, a provider may know that the designated recipient's institution imposes an incoming wire fee for receiving a transfer. Alternatively, a provider may know that foreign taxes will be collected on the remittance transfer by a person other than the remittance transfer provider. In these examples, the provider may choose, at its option, to disclose the amounts of the relevant recipient institution fee and tax as part of the information disclosed pursuant to \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1)(viii). The provider must not include that fee or tax in the amount disclosed pursuant to \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1)(vi) or (b)(1)(vii). Fees and taxes disclosed under \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1)(viii) must be disclosed in the currency in which the funds will be received. *See* comment 31(b)(1)(vi)-1. Estimates of any non-covered third-party fees and any taxes collected on the remittance transfer by a person other than the provider must be disclosed in accordance with \u00a7 1005.32(b)(3).\r\n\r\n{31-b-2-Interp}\r\n#### 31(b)(2) Receipt\r\n\r\n{31-b-2-Interp-1}\r\n1. *Date funds will be available.* A remittance transfer provider does not comply with the requirements of \u00a7 1005.31(b)(2)(ii) if it provides a range of dates that the remittance transfer may be available or an estimate of the date on which funds will be available. If a provider does not know the exact date on which funds will be available, the provider may disclose the latest date on which the funds will be available. For example, if funds may be available on January 3, but are not certain to be available until January 10, then a provider complies with \u00a7 1005.31(b)(2)(ii) if it discloses January 10 as the date funds will be available. However, a remittance transfer provider may also disclose that funds \u201cmay be available sooner\u201d or use a substantially similar term to inform senders that funds may be available to the designated recipient on a date earlier than the date disclosed. For example, a provider may disclose \u201cJanuary 10 (may be available sooner).\u201d\r\n\r\n{31-b-2-Interp-2}\r\n2. *Agencies required to be disclosed.* A remittance transfer provider must only disclose information about a State agency that licenses or charters the remittance transfer provider with respect to the remittance transfer as applicable. For example, if a financial institution is solely regulated by a Federal agency, and not licensed or chartered by a State agency, then the institution need not disclose information about a State agency. A remittance transfer provider must disclose information about the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, whether or not the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is the provider's primary Federal regulator.\r\n\r\n{31-b-2-Interp-3}\r\n3. *State agency that licenses or charters a provider.* A remittance transfer provider must only disclose information about one State agency that licenses or charters the remittance transfer provider with respect to the remittance transfer, even if other State agencies also regulate the remittance transfer provider. For example, a provider may disclose information about the State agency which granted its license. If a provider is licensed in multiple States, and the State agency that licenses the provider with respect to the remittance transfer is determined by a sender's location, a provider may make the determination as to the State in which the sender is located based on information that is provided by the sender and on any records associated with the sender. For example, if the State agency that licenses the provider with respect to an online remittance transfer is determined by a sender's location, a provider could rely on the sender's statement regarding the State in which the sender is located and disclose the State agency that licenses the provider in that State. A State-chartered bank must disclose information about the State agency that granted its charter, regardless of the location of the sender.\r\n\r\n{31-b-2-Interp-4}\r\n4. *Web site of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.* Section 1005.31(b)(2)(vi) requires a remittance transfer provider to disclose the name, toll-free telephone number(s), and Web site of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Providers may satisfy this requirement by disclosing the Web site of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's homepage, *www.consumerfinance.gov,* as shown on Model Forms A-32, A-34, A-35, and A-39. Alternatively, providers may, but are not required to, disclose the Bureau's Web site as the address of a page on the Bureau's Web site that provides information for consumers about remittance transfers, currently, *consumerfinance.gov/sending-money*, as shown on Model Form A-31. In addition, providers making disclosures in a language other than English pursuant to \u00a7 1005.31(g) may, but are not required to, disclose the Bureau's Web site as a page on the Bureau's Web site that provides information for consumers about remittance transfers in the relevant language, if such Web site exists. For example, a provider that is making disclosures in Spanish under \u00a7 1005.31(g) may, but is not required to, disclose the Bureau's Web site on Spanish-language disclosures as the page on the Bureau's Web site that provides information regarding remittance transfers in Spanish, currently *consumerfinance.gov/envios.* This optional disclosure is shown on Model A-40. The Bureau will publish a list of any other foreign language Web sites that provide information regarding remittance transfers.\r\n\r\n{31-b-2-Interp-5}\r\n5. *Date of transfer on receipt.* Where applicable, \u00a7 1005.31(b)(2)(vii) requires disclosure of the date of transfer for the remittance transfer that is the subject of a receipt required by \u00a7 1005.31(b)(2), including a receipt that is provided in accordance with the timing requirements in \u00a7 1005.36(a). For any subsequent preauthorized remittance transfer subject to \u00a7 1005.36(d)(2)(ii), the future date of transfer must be provided on any receipt provided for the initial transfer in that series of preauthorized remittance transfers, or where permitted, or disclosed as permitted by \u00a7 1005.31(a)(3) and (a)(5), in accordance with \u00a7 1005.36(a)(1)(i).\r\n\r\n{31-b-2-Interp-6}\r\n6. *Transfer date disclosures.* The following example demonstrates how the information required by \u00a7 1005.31(b)(2)(vii) and \u00a7 1005.36(d)(1) should be disclosed on receipts: On July 1, a sender instructs the provider to send a preauthorized remittance transfer of US$100 each week to a designated recipient. The sender requests that first transfer in the series be sent on July 15. On the receipt, the remittance transfer provider discloses an estimated exchange rate to the sender pursuant to \u00a7 1005.32(b)(2). In accordance with \u00a7 1005.31(b)(2)(vii), the provider should disclose the date of transfer for that particular transaction ( *i.e.,* July 15) on the receipt provided when payment is made for the transfer pursuant to the timing requirements in \u00a7 1005.36(a)(1)(i). The second receipt, which \u00a7 1005.36(a)(1)(ii) requires to be provided within one business day after the date of the transfer or, for transfers from the sender's account held by the provider, on the next regularly scheduled periodic statement or within 30 days after payment is made if a periodic statement is not provided, is also required to include the date of transfer. If the provider discloses on either receipt the cancellation period applicable to and dates of subsequent preauthorized remittance transfers in accordance with \u00a7 1005.36(d)(2), the disclosure must be phrased and formatted in such a way that it is clear to the sender which cancellation period is applicable to any date of transfer on the receipt.\r\n\r\n{31-b-2-Interp-7}\r\n7. *Cancellation disclosure.* Remittance transfer providers that offer remittance transfers scheduled three or more business days before the date of the transfer, as well as remittance transfers scheduled fewer than three business days before the date of the transfer, may meet the cancellation disclosure requirements in \u00a7 1005.31(b)(2)(iv) by describing the three-business-day and 30-minute cancellation periods on the same disclosure and using a checkbox or other method to clearly designate the applicable cancellation period. The provider may use a number of methods to indicate which cancellation period applies to the transaction including, but not limited to, a statement to that effect, use of a checkbox, highlighting, circling, and the like. For transfers scheduled three business days before the date of the transfer, the cancellation disclosures provided pursuant to \u00a7 1005.31(b)(2)(iv) should be phrased and formatted in such a way that it is clear to the sender which cancellation period is applicable to the date of transfer disclosed on the receipt.\r\n\r\n{31-b-3-Interp}\r\n#### 31(b)(3) Combined Disclosure\r\n\r\n{31-b-3-Interp-1}\r\n1. *Proof of payment.* If a sender initiating a remittance transfer receives a combined disclosure provided under \u00a7 1005.31(b)(3) and then completes the transaction, the remittance transfer provider must provide the sender with proof of payment. The proof of payment must be clear and conspicuous, provided in writing or electronically, and provided in a retainable form. The combined disclosure must be provided to the sender when the sender requests the remittance transfer, but prior to payment for the transfer, pursuant to \u00a7 1005.31(e)(1), and the proof of payment must be provided when payment is made for the remittance transfer. The proof of payment for the transaction may be provided on the same piece of paper as the combined disclosure or on a separate piece of paper. For example, a provider may feed a combined disclosure through a computer printer when payment is made to add the date and time of the transaction, a confirmation code, and an indication that the transfer was paid in full. A provider may also provide this additional information to a sender on a separate piece of paper when payment is made. A remittance transfer provider does not comply with the requirements of \u00a7 1005.31(b)(3) by providing a combined disclosure with no further indication that payment has been received.\r\n\r\n{31-b-3-Interp-2}\r\n2. *Confirmation of scheduling.* As discussed in comment 31(e)-2, payment is considered to be made when payment is authorized for purposes of various timing requirements in subpart B, including with regard to the timing requirement for provision of the proof of payment described in \u00a7 1005.31(b)(3)(i). However, where a transfer (whether a one-time remittance transfer or the first in a series of preauthorized remittance transfers) is scheduled before the date of transfer and the provider does not intend to process payment until at or near the date of transfer, the provider may provide a confirmation of scheduling in lieu of the proof of payment required by \u00a7 1005.31(b)(3)(i). No further proof of payment is required when payment is later processed.\r\n\r\n{31-c-Interp}\r\n#### 31(c) Specific Format Requirements\r\n\r\n{31-c-1-Interp}\r\n#### 31(c)(1) Grouping\r\n\r\n{31-c-1-Interp-1}\r\n1. *Grouping.* Information is grouped together for purposes of subpart B if multiple disclosures are in close proximity to one another and a sender can reasonably calculate the total amount of the transaction and the amount that will be received by the designated recipient. Model Forms A-30(a)-(d) through A-35 in Appendix A illustrate how information may be grouped to comply with the rule, but a remittance transfer provider may group the information in another manner. For example, a provider could provide the grouped information as a horizontal, rather than a vertical, calculation. A provider could also send multiple text messages sequentially to provide the full disclosure.\r\n\r\n{31-c-4-Interp}\r\n#### 31(c)(4) Segregation\r\n\r\n{31-c-4-Interp-1}\r\n1. *Segregation.* Disclosures may be segregated from other information in a variety of ways. For example, the disclosures may appear on a separate sheet of paper or may appear on the front of a page where other information appears on the back of that page. The disclosures may be set off from other information on a notice by outlining them in a box or series of boxes, with bold print dividing lines or a different color background, or by using other means.\r\n\r\n{31-c-4-Interp-2}\r\n2. *Directly related.* For purposes of \u00a7 1005.31(c)(4), the following is directly related information:\r\n\r\n{31-c-4-Interp-2-i}\r\ni. The date and time of the transaction;\r\n\r\n{31-c-4-Interp-2-ii}\r\nii. The sender's name and contact information;\r\n\r\n{31-c-4-Interp-2-iii}\r\niii. The location at which the designated recipient may pick up the funds;\r\n\r\n{31-c-4-Interp-2-iv}\r\niv. The confirmation or other identification code;\r\n\r\n{31-c-4-Interp-2-v}\r\nv. A company name and logo;\r\n\r\n{31-c-4-Interp-2-vi}\r\nvi. An indication that a disclosure is or is not a receipt or other indicia of proof of payment;\r\n\r\n{31-c-4-Interp-2-vii}\r\nvii. A designated area for signatures or initials;\r\n\r\n{31-c-4-Interp-2-viii}\r\nviii. A statement that funds may be available sooner, as permitted by \u00a7 1005.31(b)(2)(ii);\r\n\r\n{31-c-4-Interp-2-ix}\r\nix. Instructions regarding the retrieval of funds, such as the number of days the funds will be available to the recipient before they are returned to the sender; and\r\n\r\n{31-c-4-Interp-2-x}\r\nx. A statement that the provider makes money from foreign currency exchange.\r\n\r\n{31-c-4-Interp-2-xi}\r\nxi. Disclosure of any non-covered third-party fees and any taxes collected by a person other than the provider pursuant to \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1)(viii).\r\n\r\n{31-d-Interp}\r\n#### 31(d) Estimates\r\n\r\n{31-d-Interp-1}\r\n1. *Terms.* A remittance transfer provider may provide estimates of the amounts required by \u00a7 1005.31(b), to the extent permitted by \u00a7 1005.32. An estimate must be described using the term \u201cEstimated\u201d or a substantially similar term in close proximity to the term or terms described. For example, a remittance transfer provider could describe an estimated disclosure as \u201cEstimated Transfer Amount,\u201d \u201cOther Estimated Fees and Taxes,\u201d or \u201cTotal to Recipient (Est.).\u201d\r\n\r\n{31-e-Interp}\r\n#### 31(e) Timing\r\n\r\n{31-e-Interp-1}\r\n1. *Request to send a remittance transfer.* Except as provided in \u00a7 1005.36(a), pre-payment and combined disclosures are required to be provided to the sender when the sender requests the remittance transfer, but prior to payment for the transfer. Whether a consumer has requested a remittance transfer depends on the facts and circumstances. A sender that asks a provider to send a remittance transfer, and provides transaction-specific information to the provider in order to send funds to a designated recipient, has requested a remittance transfer. A sender that has sent an email, fax, mailed letter, or similar written or electronic communication has not requested a remittance transfer if the provider believes that it is impractical for the provider to treat that communication as a request and if the provider treats the communication as an inquiry and subsequently responds to that inquiry by calling the consumer on a telephone and orally gathering or confirming the information needed to process a request for a remittance transfer. *See* comment 31(a)(3)-2. Likewise, a consumer who solely inquires about that day's rates and fees to send to Mexico has not requested the provider to send a remittance transfer. Conversely, a sender who asks the provider at an agent location to send money to a recipient in Mexico and provides the sender and recipient information to the provider has requested a remittance transfer.\r\n\r\n{31-e-Interp-2}\r\n2. *When payment is made.* Except as provided in \u00a7 1005.36(a), a receipt required by \u00a7 1005.31(b)(2) must be provided to the sender when payment is made for the remittance transfer. For example, a remittance transfer provider could give the sender the disclosures after the sender pays for the remittance transfer, but before the sender leaves the counter. A provider could also give the sender the disclosures immediately before the sender pays for the transaction. For purposes of subpart B, payment is made, for example, when a sender provides cash to the remittance transfer provider or when payment is authorized.\r\n\r\n{31-e-Interp-3}\r\n3. *Telephone transfer from an account.* A sender may transfer funds from his or her account, as defined by \u00a7 1005.2(b), that is held by the remittance transfer provider. For example, a financial institution may send an international wire transfer for a sender using funds from the sender's account with the institution. Except as provided in \u00a7 1005.36(a), if the sender conducts such a transfer entirely by telephone, the institution may provide a receipt required by \u00a7 1005.31(b)(2) on or with the sender's next regularly scheduled periodic statement for that account or within 30 days after payment is made for the remittance transfer if a periodic statement is not provided.\r\n\r\n{31-e-Interp-4}\r\n4. *Mobile application and text message transactions.* If a transaction is conducted entirely by telephone via mobile application or text message, a receipt required by \u00a7 1005.31(b)(2) may be mailed or delivered to the sender pursuant to the timing requirements in \u00a7 1005.31(e)(2). For example, if a sender conducts a transfer entirely by telephone via mobile application, a remittance transfer provider may mail or deliver the disclosures to a sender pursuant to the timing requirements in \u00a7 1005.31(e)(2).\r\n\r\n{31-e-Interp-5}\r\n5. *Statement about cancellation rights.* The statement about the rights of the sender regarding cancellation required by \u00a7 1005.31(b)(2)(iv) may, but need not, be disclosed pursuant to the timing requirements of \u00a7 1005.31(e)(2) if a provider discloses this information pursuant to \u00a7 1005.31(a)(3)(iii) or (a)(5)(iii). The statement about the rights of the sender regarding error resolution required by \u00a7 1005.31(b)(2)(iv), however, must be disclosed pursuant to the timing requirements of \u00a7 1005.31(e)(2).\r\n\r\n{31-f-Interp}\r\n#### 31(f) Accurate When Payment Is Made\r\n\r\n{31-f-Interp-1}\r\n1. *No guarantee of disclosures provided before payment.* Except as provided in \u00a7 1005.36(b), disclosures required by \u00a7 1005.31(b) or permitted by \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1)(viii) must be accurate when a sender makes payment for the remittance transfer. A remittance transfer provider is not required to guarantee the terms of the remittance transfer in the disclosures required or permitted by \u00a7 1005.31(b) for any specific period of time. However, if any of the disclosures required by \u00a7 1005.31(b) or permitted by \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1)(viii) are not accurate when a sender makes payment for the remittance transfer, a provider must give new disclosures before accepting payment.\r\n\r\n{31-g-Interp}\r\n#### 31(g) Foreign Language Disclosures\r\n\r\n{31-g-Interp-1}\r\n1. *Number of foreign languages used in written disclosure.* Section 1005.31(g)(1) does not limit the number of languages that may be used on a single document, but such disclosures must be clear and conspicuous pursuant to \u00a7 1005.31(a)(1). Under \u00a7 1005.31(g)(1), a remittance transfer provider may, but need not, provide the sender with a written or electronic disclosure that is in English and, if applicable, in each foreign language that the remittance transfer provider principally uses to advertise, solicit, or market either orally, in writing, or electronically, at the office in which a sender conducts a transaction or asserts an error, respectively. Alternatively, the remittance transfer provider may provide the disclosure solely in English and, if applicable, the foreign language primarily used by the sender with the remittance transfer provider to conduct the transaction or assert an error, provided such language is principally used by the remittance transfer provider to advertise, solicit, or market either orally, in writing, or electronically, at the office in which the sender conducts the transaction or asserts the error, respectively. If the remittance transfer provider chooses the alternative method, it may provide disclosures in a single document with both languages or in two separate documents with one document in English and the other document in the applicable foreign language. The following examples illustrate this concept.\r\n\r\n{31-g-Interp-1-i}\r\ni. A remittance transfer provider principally uses only Spanish and Vietnamese to advertise, solicit, or market remittance transfer services at a particular office. The remittance transfer provider may provide all senders with disclosures in English, Spanish, and Vietnamese, regardless of the language the sender uses with the remittance transfer provider to conduct the transaction or assert an error.\r\n\r\n{31-g-Interp-1-ii}\r\nii. Same facts as i. If a sender primarily uses Spanish with the remittance transfer provider to conduct a transaction or assert an error, the remittance transfer provider may provide a written or electronic disclosure in English and Spanish, whether in a single document or two separate documents. If the sender primarily uses English with the remittance transfer provider to conduct the transaction or assert an error, the remittance transfer provider may provide a written or electronic disclosure solely in English. If the sender primarily uses a foreign language with the remittance transfer provider to conduct the transaction or assert an error that the remittance transfer provider does not use to advertise, solicit, or market either orally, in writing, or electronically, at the office in which the sender conducts the transaction or asserts the error, respectively, the remittance transfer provider may provide a written or electronic disclosure solely in English.\r\n\r\n{31-g-Interp-2}\r\n2. *Primarily used.* The language primarily used by the sender with the remittance transfer provider to conduct the transaction is the primary language used by the sender with the remittance transfer provider to convey the information necessary to complete the transaction. Similarly, the language primarily used by the sender with the remittance transfer provider to assert the error is the primary language used by the sender with the remittance transfer provider to provide the information required by \u00a7 1005.33(b) to assert an error. For example:\r\n\r\n{31-g-Interp-2-i}\r\ni. A sender initiates a conversation with a remittance transfer provider with a greeting in English and expresses interest in sending a remittance transfer to Mexico in English. If the remittance transfer provider thereafter communicates with the sender in Spanish and the sender conveys the other information needed to complete the transaction, including the designated recipient's information and the amount and funding source of the transfer, in Spanish, then Spanish is the language primarily used by the sender with the remittance transfer provider to conduct the transaction.\r\n\r\n{31-g-Interp-2-ii}\r\nii. A sender initiates a conversation with the remittance transfer provider with a greeting in English and states in English that there was a problem with a prior remittance transfer to Vietnam. If the remittance transfer provider thereafter communicates with the sender in Vietnamese and the sender uses Vietnamese to convey the information required by \u00a7 1005.33(b) to assert an error, then Vietnamese is the language primarily used by the sender with the remittance transfer provider to assert the error.\r\n\r\n{31-g-Interp-2-iii}\r\niii. A sender accesses the Web site of a remittance transfer provider that may be used by senders to conduct remittance transfers or assert errors. The Web site is offered in English and French. If the sender uses the French version of the Web site to conduct the remittance transfer, then French is the language primarily used by the sender with the remittance transfer provider to conduct the transaction.\r\n\r\n{31-g-1-Interp}\r\n#### 31(g)(1) General\r\n\r\n{31-g-1-Interp-1}\r\n1. *Principally used.*\r\n\r\n{31-g-1-Interp-1-i}\r\ni. All relevant facts and circumstances determine whether a foreign language is principally used by the remittance transfer provider to advertise, solicit, or market under \u00a7 1005.31(g)(1). Generally, whether a foreign language is considered to be principally used by the remittance transfer provider to advertise, solicit, or market is based on:\r\n\r\n{31-g-1-Interp-1-i-A}\r\nA. The frequency with which the foreign language is used in advertising, soliciting, or marketing of remittance transfer services at that office;\r\n\r\n{31-g-1-Interp-1-i-B}\r\nB. The prominence of the advertising, soliciting, or marketing of remittance transfer services in that foreign language at that office; and\r\n\r\n{31-g-1-Interp-1-i-C}\r\nC. The specific foreign language terms used in the advertising soliciting, or marketing of remittance transfer service at that office.\r\n\r\n{31-g-1-Interp-1-ii}\r\nii. For example, if a remittance transfer provider posts several prominent advertisements in a foreign language for remittance transfer services, including rate and fee information, on a consistent basis in an office, the provider is creating an expectation that a consumer could receive information on remittance transfer services in the foreign language used in the advertisements. The foreign language used in such advertisements would be considered to be principally used at that office based on the frequency and prominence of the advertising. In contrast, an advertisement for remittance transfer services, including rate and fee information, that is featured prominently at an office and is entirely in English, except for a greeting in a foreign language, does not create an expectation that a consumer could receive information on remittance transfer services in the foreign language used for such greeting. The foreign language used in such an advertisement is not considered to be principally used at that office based on the incidental specific foreign language term used.\r\n\r\n{31-g-1-Interp-2}\r\n2. *Advertise, solicit, or market.*\r\n\r\n{31-g-1-Interp-2-i}\r\ni. Any commercial message in a foreign language, appearing in any medium, that promotes directly or indirectly the availability of remittance transfer services constitutes advertising, soliciting, or marketing in such foreign language for purposes of \u00a7 1005.31(g)(1). Examples illustrating when a foreign language is used to advertise, solicit, or market include:\r\n\r\n{31-g-1-Interp-2-i-A}\r\nA. Messages in a foreign language in a leaflet or promotional flyer at an office.\r\n\r\n{31-g-1-Interp-2-i-B}\r\nB. Announcements in a foreign language on a public address system at an office.\r\n\r\n{31-g-1-Interp-2-i-C}\r\nC. On-line messages in a foreign language, such as on the internet.\r\n\r\n{31-g-1-Interp-2-i-D}\r\nD. Printed material in a foreign language on any exterior or interior sign at an office.\r\n\r\n{31-g-1-Interp-2-i-E}\r\nE. Point-of-sale displays in a foreign language at an office.\r\n\r\n{31-g-1-Interp-2-i-F}\r\nF. Telephone solicitations in a foreign language.\r\n\r\n{31-g-1-Interp-2-ii}\r\nii. Examples illustrating use of a foreign language for purposes other than to advertise, solicit, or market include:\r\n\r\n{31-g-1-Interp-2-ii-A}\r\nA. Communicating in a foreign language (whether by telephone, electronically, or otherwise) about remittance transfer services in response to a consumer-initiated inquiry.\r\n\r\n{31-g-1-Interp-2-ii-B}\r\nB. Making disclosures in a foreign language that are required by Federal or other applicable law.\r\n\r\n{31-g-1-Interp-3}\r\n3. *Office.* An office includes any physical location, telephone number, or Web site of a remittance transfer provider where a sender may conduct a remittance transfer or assert an error for a remittance transfer. The location need not exclusively offer remittance transfer services. For example, if an agent of a remittance transfer provider is located in a grocery store, the grocery store is considered an office for purposes of \u00a7 1005.31(g)(1). Because a consumer must be located in a State in order to be considered a \u201csender\u201d under \u00a7 1005.30(g), a Web site is not an office for purposes of \u00a7 1005.31(g)(1), even if the Web site can be accessed by consumers that are located in the United States, unless a sender may conduct a remittance transfer on the Web site or may assert an error for a remittance transfer on the Web site.\r\n\r\n{31-g-1-Interp-4}\r\n4. *At the office.* Any advertisement, solicitation, or marketing is considered to be made at the office in which a sender conducts a transaction or asserts an error if such advertisement, solicitation, or marketing is posted, provided, or made: at a physical office of a remittance transfer provider; on a Web site of a remittance transfer provider that may be used by senders to conduct remittance transfers or assert errors; during a telephone call with a remittance transfer provider that may be used by senders to conduct remittance transfers or assert errors; or via mobile application or text message by a remittance transfer provider if the mobile application or text message may be used by senders to conduct remittance transfers or assert errors. An advertisement, solicitation, or marketing that is considered to be made at an office does not include general advertisements, solicitations, or marketing that are not intended to be made at a particular office. For example, if an advertisement for remittance transfers in Chinese appears in a Chinese newspaper that is being distributed at a grocery store in which the agent of a remittance transfer provider is located, such advertisement would not be considered to be made at that office. For disclosures provided pursuant to \u00a7 1005.31, the relevant office is the office in which the sender conducts the transaction. For disclosures provided pursuant to \u00a7 1005.33 for error resolution purposes, the relevant office is the office in which the sender first asserts the error, not the office where the transaction was conducted.\r\n",

To the extent permitted in \u00a7 1005.32(a) and (b)(1), estimates may be used in the pre-payment disclosure described in \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1), the receipt disclosure described in \u00a7 1005.31(b)(2), the combined disclosure described in \u00a7 1005.31(b)(3), and the pre-payment disclosures and receipt disclosures for both first and subsequent preauthorized remittance transfers described in \u00a7 1005.36(a)(1) and (a)(2). Section 1005.32(b)(2) permits estimates to be used for certain information if the remittance transfer is scheduled by a sender five or more business days before the date of the transfer, for disclosures described in \u00a7 1005.36(a)(1)(i) and (a)(2)(i).\r\n\r\n{32-a-Interp}\r\n#### 32(a) Temporary Exception for Insured Institutions\r\n\r\n{32-a-1-Interp}\r\n#### 32(a)(1) General\r\n\r\n{32-a-1-Interp-1}\r\n1. *Control.* For purposes of this section, an insured institution cannot determine exact amounts \u201cfor reasons beyond its control\u201d when a person other than the insured institution or with which the insured institution has no correspondent relationship sets the exchange rate required to be disclosed under \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1)(iv) or imposes a covered third-party fee required to be disclosed under \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1)(vi). For example, if an insured institution has a correspondent relationship with an intermediary financial institution in another country and that intermediary institution sets the exchange rate or imposes a fee for remittance transfers sent from the insured institution to the intermediary institution, then the insured institution must determine exact amounts for the disclosures required under \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1)(iv) or (vi), because the determination of those amounts are not beyond the insured institution's control.\r\n\r\n{32-a-1-Interp-2}\r\n2. *Examples of scenarios that qualify for the temporary exception.* The following examples illustrate when an insured institution cannot determine an exact amount \u201cfor reasons beyond its control\u201d and thus would qualify for the temporary exception.\r\n\r\n{32-a-1-Interp-2-i}\r\ni. *Exchange rate.* An insured institution cannot determine the exact exchange rate to disclose under \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1)(iv) for an international wire transfer if the insured institution does not set the exchange rate, and the rate is set when the funds are deposited into the recipient's account by the designated recipient's institution with which the insured institution does not have a correspondent relationship. The insured institution will not know the exchange rate that the recipient institution will apply when the funds are deposited into the recipient's account.\r\n\r\n{32-a-1-Interp-2-ii}\r\nii. *Covered third-party fees.* An insured institution cannot determine the exact covered third-party fees to disclose under \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1)(vi) if an intermediary institution with which the insured institution does not have a correspondent relationship, imposes a transfer or conversion fee.\r\n\r\n{32-a-1-Interp-3}\r\n3. *Examples of scenarios that do not qualify for the temporary exception.* The following examples illustrate when an insured institution can determine exact amounts and thus would not qualify for the temporary exception.\r\n\r\n{32-a-1-Interp-3-i}\r\ni. *Exchange rate.* An insured institution can determine the exact exchange rate required to be disclosed under \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1)(iv) if it converts the funds into the local currency to be received by the designated recipient using an exchange rate that it sets. The determination of the exchange rate is in the insured institution's control even if there is no correspondent relationship with an intermediary institution in the transmittal route or the designated recipient's institution.\r\n\r\n{32-a-1-Interp-3-ii}\r\nii. *Covered third-party fees.* An insured institution can determine the exact covered third-party fees required to be disclosed under \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1)(vi) if it has agreed upon the specific fees with an intermediary correspondent institution, and this correspondent institution is the only institution in the transmittal route to the designated recipient's institution.\r\n\r\n{32-b-Interp}\r\n#### 32(b) Permanent Exceptions\r\n\r\n{32-b-1-Interp}\r\n#### 32(b)(1) Permanent Exceptions for Transfers to Certain Countries\r\n\r\n{32-b-1-Interp-1}\r\n1. *Laws of the recipient country.* The laws of the recipient country do not permit a remittance transfer provider to determine exact amounts required to be disclosed when a law or regulation of the recipient country requires the person making funds directly available to the designated recipient to apply an exchange rate that is:\r\n\r\n{32-b-1-Interp-1-i}\r\ni. Set by the government of the recipient country after the remittance transfer provider sends the remittance transfer or\r\n\r\n{32-b-1-Interp-1-ii}\r\nii. Set when the designated recipient receives the funds.\r\n\r\n{32-b-1-Interp-2}\r\n2. *Example illustrating when exact amounts can and cannot be determined because of the laws of the recipient country.*\r\n\r\n{32-b-1-Interp-2-i}\r\ni. The laws of the recipient country do not permit a remittance transfer provider to determine the exact exchange rate required to be disclosed under \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1)(iv) when, for example, the government of the recipient country, on a daily basis, sets the exchange rate that must, by law, apply to funds received and the funds are made available to the designated recipient in the local currency the day after the remittance transfer provider sends the remittance transfer.\r\n\r\n{32-b-1-Interp-2-ii}\r\nii. In contrast, the laws of the recipient country permit a remittance transfer provider to determine the exact exchange rate required to be disclosed under \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1)(iv) when, for example, the government of the recipient country ties the value of its currency to the U.S. dollar.\r\n\r\n{32-b-1-Interp-3}\r\n3. *Method by which transactions are made in the recipient country.* The method by which transactions are made in the recipient country does not permit a remittance transfer provider to determine exact amounts required to be disclosed when transactions are sent via international ACH on terms negotiated between the United States government and the recipient country's government, under which the exchange rate is a rate set by the recipient country's central bank or other governmental authority after the provider sends the remittance transfer.\r\n\r\n{32-b-1-Interp-4}\r\n4. *Example illustrating when exact amounts can and cannot be determined because of the method by which transactions are made in the recipient country.*\r\n\r\n{32-b-1-Interp-4-i}\r\ni. The method by which transactions are made in the recipient country does not permit a remittance transfer provider to determine the exact exchange rate required to be disclosed under \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1)(iv) when the provider sends a remittance transfer via international ACH on terms negotiated between the United States government and the recipient country's government, under which the exchange rate is a rate set by the recipient country's central bank on the business day after the provider has sent the remittance transfer.\r\n\r\n{32-b-1-Interp-4-ii}\r\nii. In contrast, a remittance transfer provider would not qualify for the \u00a7 1005.32(b)(1)(i)(B) methods exception if it sends a remittance transfer via international ACH on terms negotiated between the United States government and a private-sector entity or entities in the recipient country, under which the exchange rate is set by the institution acting as the entry point to the recipient country's payments system on the next business day. However, a remittance transfer provider sending a remittance transfer using such a method may qualify for the \u00a7 1005.32(a) temporary exception.\r\n\r\n{32-b-1-Interp-4-iii}\r\niii. A remittance transfer provider would not qualify for the \u00a7 1005.32(b)(1)(i)(B) methods exception if, for example, it sends a remittance transfer via international ACH on terms negotiated between the United States government and the recipient country's government, under which the exchange rate is set by the recipient country's central bank or other governmental authority before the sender requests a transfer.\r\n\r\n{32-b-1-Interp-5}\r\n5. *Safe harbor list.* If a country is included on a safe harbor list published by the Bureau under \u00a7 1005.32(b)(1)(ii), a remittance transfer provider may provide estimates of the amounts to be disclosed under \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1)(iv) through (b)(1)(vii). If a country does not appear on the Bureau's list, a remittance transfer provider may provide estimates under \u00a7 1005.32(b)(1)(i) if the provider determines that the recipient country does not legally permit or method by which transactions are conducted in that country does not permit the provider to determine exact disclosure amounts.\r\n\r\n{32-b-1-Interp-6}\r\n6. *Reliance on Bureau list of countries.* A remittance transfer provider may rely on the list of countries published by the Bureau to determine whether the laws of a recipient country do not permit the remittance transfer provider to determine exact amounts required to be disclosed under \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1)(iv) through (vii). Thus, if a country is on the Bureau's list, the provider may give estimates under this section, unless a remittance transfer provider has information that a country on the Bureau's list legally permits the provider to determine exact disclosure amounts.\r\n\r\n{32-b-1-Interp-7}\r\n7. *Change in laws of recipient country.*\r\n\r\n{32-b-1-Interp-7-i}\r\ni. If the laws of a recipient country change such that a remittance transfer provider can determine exact amounts, the remittance transfer provider must begin providing exact amounts for the required disclosures as soon as reasonably practicable if the provider has information that the country legally permits the provider to determine exact disclosure amounts.\r\n\r\n{32-b-1-Interp-7-ii}\r\nii. If the laws of a recipient country change such that a remittance transfer provider cannot determine exact disclosure amounts, the remittance transfer provider may provide estimates under \u00a7 1005.32(b)(1)(i), even if that country does not appear on the list published by the Bureau.\r\n\r\n{32-b-2-Interp}\r\n#### 32(b)(2) Permanent Exceptions for Transfers Scheduled Before the Date of Transfer\r\n\r\n{32-b-2-Interp-1}\r\n1. *Fixed amount of foreign currency.* The following is an example of when and how a remittance transfer provider may disclose estimates for remittance transfers scheduled five or more business days before the date of transfer where the provider agrees to the sender's request to fix the amount to be transferred in a currency in which the transfer will be received and not the currency in which it was funded. If on February 1, a sender schedules a 1000 Euro wire transfer to be sent from the sender's bank account denominated in U.S. dollars to a designated recipient on February 15, \u00a7 1005.32(b)(2) allows the provider to estimate the amount that will be transferred to the designated recipient ( *i.e.,* the amount described in \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1)(i)), any fees imposed or taxes collected on the remittance transfer by the provider (if based on the amount transferred) ( *i.e.,* the amount described in \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1)(ii)), and the total amount of the transaction ( *i.e.,* the amount described in \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1)(iii)). The provider may also estimate any covered third-party fees if the exchange rate is also estimated and the estimated exchange rate affects the amount of fees (as allowed by \u00a7 1005.32(b)(2)(ii)).\r\n\r\n{32-b-2-Interp-2}\r\n2. *Relationship to \u00a7 1005.10(d).* To the extent \u00a7 1005.10(d) requires, for an electronic fund transfer that is also a remittance transfer, notice when a preauthorized electronic fund transfer from the consumer's account will vary in amount from the previous transfer under the same authorization or from the preauthorized amount, that provision applies even if subpart B would not otherwise require notice before the date of transfer. However, insofar as \u00a7 1005.10(d) does not specify the form of such notice, a notice sent pursuant to \u00a7 1005.36(a)(2)(i) will satisfy \u00a7 1005.10(d) as long as the timing requirements of \u00a7 1005.10(d) are satisfied.\r\n\r\n{32-b-3-Interp}\r\n#### 32(b)(3) Permanent Exception for Optional Disclosure of Non-Covered Third-Party Fees and Taxes Collected on the Remittance Transfer by a Person Other Than the Provider\r\n\r\n{32-b-3-Interp-1}\r\n1. *Reasonable sources of information.* Pursuant to \u00a7 1005.32(b)(3) a remittance transfer provider may estimate applicable non-covered third-party fees and taxes collected on the remittance transfer by a person other than the provider using reasonable sources of information. Reasonable sources of information may include, for example: information obtained from recent transfers to the same institution or the same country or region; fee schedules from the recipient institution; fee schedules from the recipient institution's competitors; surveys of recipient institution fees in the same country or region as the recipient institution; information provided or surveys of recipient institutions' regulators or taxing authorities; commercially or publicly available databases, services or sources; and information or resources developed by international nongovernmental organizations or intergovernmental organizations.\r\n\r\n{32-c-Interp}\r\n#### 32(c) Bases for Estimates\r\n\r\n{32-c-1-Interp}\r\n#### 32(c)(1) Exchange Rate\r\n\r\n{32-c-1-Interp-1}\r\n*1. Most recent exchange rate for qualifying international ACH transfers.* If the exchange rate for a remittance transfer sent via international ACH that qualifies for the \u00a7 1005.32(b)(1)(i)(B) exception is set the following business day, the most recent exchange rate available for a transfer is the exchange rate set for the day that the disclosure is provided, *i.e.,* the current business day's exchange rate.\r\n\r\n{32-c-1-Interp-2}\r\n2. *Publicly available.* Examples of publicly available sources of information containing the most recent wholesale exchange rate for a currency include U.S. news services, such as Bloomberg, the Wall Street Journal, and the New York Times; a recipient country's national news services, and a recipient country's central bank or other government agency.\r\n\r\n{32-c-1-Interp-3}\r\n3. *Spread.* An estimate for disclosing the exchange rate based on the most recent publicly available wholesale exchange rate must also reflect any spread the remittance transfer provider typically applies to the wholesale exchange rate for remittance transfers for a particular currency.\r\n\r\n{32-c-1-Interp-4}\r\n4. *Most recent.* For the purposes of \u00a7 1005.32(c)(1)(ii) and (iii), if the exchange rate with respect to a particular currency is published or provided multiple times throughout the day because the exchange rate fluctuates throughout the day, a remittance transfer provider may use any exchange rate available on that day to determine the most recent exchange rate.\r\n\r\n{32-c-3-Interp}\r\n#### 32(c)(3) Covered Third-Party Fees\r\n\r\n{32-c-3-Interp-1}\r\n1. *Potential transmittal routes.* A remittance transfer from the sender's account at an insured institution to the designated recipient's institution may take several routes, depending on the correspondent relationships each institution in the transmittal route has with other institutions. In providing an estimate of the fees required to be disclosed under \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1)(vi) pursuant to the \u00a7 1005.32(a) temporary exception, an insured institution may rely upon the representations of the designated recipient's institution and the institutions that act as intermediaries in any one of the potential transmittal routes that it reasonably believes a requested remittance transfer may travel.\r\n\r\n{32-d-Interp}\r\n#### 32(d) Bases for Estimates for Transfers Scheduled Before the Date of Transfer\r\n\r\n{32-d-Interp-1}\r\n1. *In general.* When providing an estimate pursuant to \u00a7 1005.32(b)(2), \u00a7 1005.32(d) requires that a remittance transfer provider's estimated exchange rate must be the exchange rate (or estimated exchange rate) that the remittance transfer provider would have used or did use that day in providing disclosures to a sender requesting such a remittance transfer to be made on the same day. If, for the same-day remittance transfer, the provider could utilize either of the other two exceptions permitting the provision of estimates in \u00a7 1005.32(a) or (b)(1), the provider may provide estimates based on a methodology permitted under \u00a7 1005.32(c). For example, if, on February 1, the sender schedules a remittance transfer to occur on February 10, the provider should disclose the exchange rate as if the sender was requesting the transfer be sent on February 1. However, if at the time payment is made for the requested transfer, the remittance transfer provider could not send any remittance transfer until the next day (for reasons such as the provider's deadline for the batching of transfers), the remittance transfer provider can use the rate (or estimated exchange rate) that the remittance transfer provider would have used or did use in providing disclosures that day with respect to a remittance transfer requested that day that could not be sent until the following day.\r\n\r\n",

Such error may be asserted by a sender regardless of the form or method of payment provided, including when a debit, credit, or prepaid card is used to fund the transfer and an excess amount is paid. For example, if a remittance transfer provider incorrectly charged a sender's credit card account for US$150, and US$120 was sent, plus a transfer fee of US$10, the sender could assert an error with the remittance transfer provider for the incorrect charge under \u00a7 1005.33(a)(1)(i).\r\n\r\n{33-a-Interp-2}\r\n2. *Incorrect amount of currency received - coverage.* Section 1005.33(a)(1)(iii) covers circumstances in which the designated recipient receives an amount of currency that differs from the amount of currency identified on the disclosures provided to the sender, except where the disclosure stated an estimate of the amount of currency to be received in accordance with \u00a7 1005.32 and the difference results from application of the actual exchange rate, fees, and taxes, rather than any estimated amounts, or the failure was caused by circumstances outside the remittance transfer provider's control. A designated recipient may receive an amount of currency that differs from the amount of currency disclosed, for example, if an exchange rate other than the disclosed rate is applied to the remittance transfer, or if the provider fails to account for fees or taxes that may be imposed by the provider or a third party before the transfer is picked up by the designated recipient or deposited into the recipient's account in the foreign country. However, if the provider rounds the exchange rate used to calculate the amount received consistent with \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1)(iv) and comment 31(b)(1)(iv)-2 for the disclosed rate, there is no error if the designated recipient receives an amount of currency that results from applying the exchange rate used, prior to any rounding of the exchange rate, to calculate fees, taxes, or the amount received rather than the disclosed rate. Section 1005.33(a)(1)(iii) also covers circumstances in which the remittance transfer provider transmits an amount that differs from the amount requested by the sender.\r\n\r\n{33-a-Interp-3}\r\n3. *Incorrect amount of currency received - examples.* For purposes of the following examples illustrating the error for an incorrect amount of currency received under \u00a7 1005.33(a)(1)(iii), assume that none of the circumstances permitting an estimate under \u00a7 1005.32 apply (unless otherwise stated).\r\n\r\n{33-a-Interp-3-i}\r\ni. A consumer requests to send funds to a relative in Mexico to be received in local currency. Upon receiving the sender's payment, the remittance transfer provider provides a receipt indicating that the amount of currency that will be received by the designated recipient will be 1180 Mexican pesos, after fees and taxes are applied. However, when the relative picks up the transfer in Mexico a day later, he only receives 1150 Mexican pesos because the exchange rate applied by the recipient agent in Mexico was lower than the exchange rate used by the provider, prior to any rounding of the exchange rate, to disclose the amount of currency to be received by the designated recipient on the receipt. Because the designated recipient has received less than the amount of currency disclosed on the receipt, an error has occurred.\r\n\r\n{33-a-Interp-3-ii}\r\nii. A consumer requests to send funds to a relative in Colombia to be received in local currency. The remittance transfer provider provides the sender a receipt stating an amount of currency that will be received by the designated recipient, which does not reflect the additional foreign taxes that will be collected in Colombia on the transfer but does include the statement required by \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1)(viii). If the designated recipient will receive less than the amount of currency disclosed on the receipt due solely to the additional foreign taxes that the provider was not required to disclose, no error has occurred.\r\n\r\n{33-a-Interp-3-iii}\r\niii. Same facts as in ii., except that the receipt provided by the remittance transfer provider does not reflect additional fees that are imposed by the receiving agent in Colombia on the transfer. Because the designated recipient will receive less than the amount of currency disclosed in the receipt due to the additional covered third-party fees, an error has occurred.\r\n\r\n{33-a-Interp-3-iv}\r\niv. A consumer requests to send US$250 to a relative in India to a U.S. dollar-denominated account held by the relative at an Indian bank. Instead of the US$250 disclosed on the receipt as the amount to be sent, the remittance transfer provider sends US$200, resulting in a smaller deposit to the designated recipient's account than was disclosed as the amount to be received after fees and taxes. Because the designated recipient received less than the amount of currency that was disclosed, an error has occurred.\r\n\r\n{33-a-Interp-3-v}\r\nv. A consumer requests to send US$100 to a relative in a foreign country to be received in local currency. The remittance transfer provider provides the sender a receipt that discloses an estimated exchange rate, other taxes, and amount of currency that will be received due to the law in the foreign country requiring that the exchange rate be set by the foreign country's central bank. When the relative picks up the remittance transfer, the relative receives less currency than the estimated amount disclosed to the sender on the receipt due to application of the actual exchange rate, fees, and taxes, rather than any estimated amounts. Because \u00a7 1005.32(b) permits the remittance transfer provider to disclose an estimate of the amount of currency to be received, no error has occurred unless the estimate was not based on an approach set forth under \u00a7 1005.32(c).\r\n\r\n{33-a-Interp-3-vi}\r\nvi. A sender requests that his bank send US$120 to a designated recipient's account at an institution in a foreign country. The foreign institution is not an agent of the provider. Only US$100 is deposited into the designated recipient's account because the recipient institution imposed a US$20 incoming wire fee and deducted the fee from the amount transferred. Because this fee is a non-covered third-party fee that the provider is not required to disclose under \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1)(vi), no error has occurred if the provider provided the disclosure required by \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1)(viii).\r\n\r\n{33-a-Interp-4}\r\n4. *Incorrect amount of currency received - extraordinary circumstances.* Under \u00a7 1005.33(a)(1)(iii)(B), a remittance transfer provider's failure to make available to a designated recipient the amount of currency disclosed pursuant to \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1)(vii) and stated in the disclosure provided pursuant to \u00a7 1005.31(b)(2) or (3) for the remittance transfer is not an error if such failure was caused by extraordinary circumstances outside the remittance transfer provider's control that could not have been reasonably anticipated. Examples of extraordinary circumstances outside the remittance transfer provider's control that could not have been reasonably anticipated under \u00a7 1005.33(a)(1)(iii)(B) include circumstances such as war or civil unrest, natural disaster, garnishment or attachment of some of the funds after the transfer is sent, and government actions or restrictions that could not have been reasonably anticipated by the remittance transfer provider, such as the imposition of foreign currency controls or foreign taxes unknown at the time the receipt or combined disclosure is provided under \u00a7 1005.31(b)(2) or (3).\r\n\r\n{33-a-Interp-5}\r\n5. *Failure to make funds available by disclosed date of availability - coverage.* Section 1005.33(a)(1)(iv) generally covers disputes about the failure to make funds available in connection with a remittance transfer to a designated recipient by the disclosed date of availability. If only a portion of the funds were made available by the disclosed date of availability, then \u00a7 1005.33(a)(1)(iv) does not apply, but \u00a7 1005.33(a)(1)(iii) may apply instead. The following are examples of errors for failure to make funds available by the disclosed date of availability (assuming that none of the exceptions in \u00a7 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(A), (B), or (C) apply).\r\n\r\n{33-a-Interp-5-i}\r\ni. Late or non-delivery of a remittance transfer;\r\n\r\n{33-a-Interp-5-ii}\r\nii. Delivery of funds to the wrong account;\r\n\r\n{33-a-Interp-5-iii}\r\niii. The fraudulent pick-up of a remittance transfer in a foreign country by a person other than the designated recipient;\r\n\r\n{33-a-Interp-5-iv}\r\niv. The recipient agent or institution's retention of the remittance transfer, instead of making the funds available to the designated recipient.\r\n\r\n{33-a-Interp-6}\r\n6. *Failure to make funds available by disclosed date of availability - extraordinary circumstances.* Under \u00a7 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(A), a remittance transfer provider's failure to deliver or transmit a remittance transfer by the disclosed date of availability is not an error if such failure was caused by extraordinary circumstances outside the remittance transfer provider's control that could not have been reasonably anticipated. Examples of extraordinary circumstances outside the remittance transfer provider's control that could not have been reasonably anticipated under \u00a7 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(A) include circumstances such as war or civil unrest, natural disaster, garnishment or attachment of funds after the transfer is sent, and government actions or restrictions that could not have been reasonably anticipated by the remittance transfer provider, such as the imposition of foreign currency controls.\r\n\r\n{33-a-Interp-7}\r\n7. *Failure to make funds available by disclosed date of availability - fraud and other screening procedures.* Under \u00a7 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(B), a remittance transfer provider's failure to deliver funds by the disclosed date of availability is not an error if such delay is related to the provider's or any third party's investigation necessary to address potentially suspicious, blocked or prohibited activity, and the provider did not and could not have reasonably foreseen the delay so as to enable it to timely disclose an accurate date of availability when providing the sender with a receipt or combined disclosure. For example, no error occurs if delivery of funds is delayed because, after the receipt is provided, the provider's fraud screening system flags a remittance transfer because the designated recipient has a name similar to the name of a blocked person under a sanctions program and further investigation is needed to determine that the designated recipient is not actually a blocked person. Similarly, no error occurs where, after disclosing a date of availability to the sender, a remittance transfer provider receives specific law enforcement information indicating that the characteristics of a remittance transfer match a pattern of fraudulent activity, and as a result, the provider deems it necessary to delay delivery of the funds to allow for further investigation. However, if a delay could have been reasonably foreseen, the exception in \u00a7 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(B) would not apply. For example, if a provider knows in time to make a disclosure that all remittance transfers to a certain geographic area must undergo screening procedures that routinely delay such transfers by two days, the provider's failure to include the additional two days in its disclosure of the date of availability constitutes an error if delivery of the funds is indeed delayed beyond the disclosed date of availability.\r\n\r\n{33-a-Interp-8}\r\n8. *Sender account number or recipient institution identifier error.* The exception in \u00a7 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(D) applies where a sender gives the remittance transfer provider an incorrect account number or recipient institution identifier and all five conditions in \u00a7 1005.33(h) are satisfied. The exception does not apply, however, where the failure to make funds available is the result of a mistake by a provider or a third party or due to incorrect or insufficient information provided by the sender other than an incorrect account number or recipient institution identifier, such as an incorrect name of the recipient institution.\r\n\r\n{33-a-Interp-9}\r\n9. *Account number or recipient institution identifier.* For purposes of the exception in \u00a7 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(D), the terms account number and recipient institution identifier refer to alphanumerical account or institution identifiers other than names or addresses, such as account numbers, routing numbers, Canadian transit numbers, International Bank Account Numbers (IBANs), Business Identifier Codes (BICs) and other similar account or institution identifiers used to route a transaction. In addition and for purposes of this exception, the term designated recipient's account in \u00a7 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(D) refers to an asset account, regardless of whether it is a consumer asset account, established for any purpose and held by a bank, savings association, credit union, or equivalent institution. A designated recipient's account does not, however, include a credit card, prepaid card, or a virtual account held by an Internet-based or mobile telephone company that is not a bank, savings association, credit union or equivalent institution.\r\n\r\n{33-a-Interp-10}\r\n10. *Recipient-requested changes.* Under \u00a7 1005.33(a)(2)(iii), a change requested by the designated recipient that the remittance transfer provider or others involved in the remittance transfer decide to accommodate is not considered an error. The exception under \u00a7 1005.33(a)(2)(iii) is available only if the change is made solely because the designated recipient requested the change. For example, if a sender requests to send US$100 to a designated recipient at a designated location, but the designated recipient requests the amount in a different currency (either at the sender-designated location or another location requested by the recipient) and the remittance transfer provider accommodates the recipient's request, the change does not constitute an error.\r\n\r\n{33-a-Interp-11}\r\n11. *Change from disclosure made in reliance on sender information.* Under the commentary accompanying \u00a7 1005.31, the remittance transfer provider may rely on the sender's representations in making certain disclosures. *See, e.g.,* comments 31(b)(1)(iv)-1 and 31(b)(1)(vi)-1. For example, suppose a sender requests U.S. dollars to be deposited into an account of the designated recipient and represents that the account is U.S. dollar-denominated. If the designated recipient's account is actually denominated in local currency and the recipient account-holding institution must convert the remittance transfer into local currency in order to deposit the funds and complete the transfer, the change in currency does not constitute an error pursuant to \u00a7 1005.33(a)(2)(iv).\r\n\r\n{33-b-Interp}\r\n#### 33(b) Notice of Error From Sender\r\n\r\n{33-b-Interp-1}\r\n1. *Person asserting or discovering error.* The error resolution procedures of this section apply only when a notice of error is received from the sender, and not when a notice of error is received from the designated recipient or when the remittance transfer provider itself discovers and corrects an error.\r\n\r\n{33-b-Interp-2}\r\n2. *Content of error notice.* The notice of error is effective so long as the remittance transfer provider is able to identify the elements in \u00a7 1005.33(b)(1)(ii). For example, the sender could provide the confirmation number or code that would be used by the designated recipient to pick up the transfer, or other identification number or code supplied by the remittance transfer provider in connection with the transfer, if such number or code is sufficient for the remittance transfer provider to identify the sender (and contact information), designated recipient, and the transfer in question. For an account-based remittance transfer, the notice of error is effective even if it does not contain the sender's account number, so long as the remittance transfer provider is able to identify the account and the transfer in question.\r\n\r\n{33-b-Interp-3}\r\n3. *Address on notice of error.* A remittance transfer provider may request, or a sender may provide, the sender's or designated recipient's email address, as applicable, instead of a physical address, on a notice of error.\r\n\r\n{33-b-Interp-4}\r\n4. *Effect of late notice.* A remittance transfer provider is not required to comply with the requirements of this section for any notice of error from a sender that is received by the provider more than 180 days from the disclosed date of availability of the remittance transfer to which the notice of error applies or, if applicable, more than 60 days after a provider sent documentation, additional information, or clarification requested by the sender, provided such date is later than 180 days after the disclosed date of availability.\r\n\r\n{33-b-Interp-5}\r\n5. *Notice of error provided to agent.* A notice of error provided by a sender to an agent of the remittance transfer provider is deemed to be received by the provider under \u00a7 1005.33(b)(1)(i) when received by the agent.\r\n\r\n{33-b-Interp-6}\r\n6. *Consumer notice of error resolution rights.* Section 1005.31 requires a remittance transfer provider to include an abbreviated notice of the consumer's error resolution rights on the receipt or combined notice provided under \u00a7 1005.31(b)(2) or (3). In addition, the remittance transfer provider must make available to a sender upon request, a notice providing a full description of the sender's error resolution rights, using language set forth in Appendix A of this part (Model Form A-36) or substantially similar language.\r\n\r\n{33-c-Interp}\r\n#### 33(c) Time Limits and Extent of Investigation\r\n\r\n{33-c-Interp-1}\r\n1. *Notice to sender of finding of error.* If the remittance transfer provider determines during its investigation that an error occurred as described by the sender, the remittance provider may inform the sender of its findings either orally or in writing. However, if the provider determines that no error or a different error occurred, the provider must provide a written explanation of its findings under \u00a7 1005.33(d)(1).\r\n\r\n{33-c-Interp-2}\r\n2. *Incorrect or insufficient information provided for transfer.* The remedy in \u00a7 1005.33(c)(2)(iii) applies if a remittance transfer provider's failure to make funds in connection with a remittance transfer available to a designated recipient by the disclosed date of availability occurred because the sender provided incorrect or insufficient information in connection with the transfer, such as by erroneously identifying the designated recipient's address or by providing insufficient information such that the entity distributing the funds cannot identify the correct designated recipient. A sender is not considered to have provided incorrect or insufficient information for purposes of \u00a7 1005.33(c)(2)(iii) if the provider discloses the incorrect location where the transfer may be picked up, gives the wrong confirmation number/code for the transfer, or otherwise miscommunicates information necessary for the designated recipient to pick-up the transfer. The remedies in \u00a7 1005.33(c)(2)(iii) do not apply if the sender provided an incorrect account number or recipient institution identifier and the provider has met the requirements of \u00a7 1005.33(h) because under \u00a7 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(D) no error would have occurred. *See* \u00a7 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(D) and comment 33(a)-7.\r\n\r\n{33-c-Interp-3}\r\n3. *Designation of requested remedy.* Under \u00a7 1005.33(c)(2)(ii), the sender may generally choose to obtain a refund of funds that were not properly transmitted or delivered to the designated recipient or, request redelivery of the amount appropriate to correct the error at no additional cost unless the error is determined to have occurred because the sender provided incorrect or insufficient information. Upon receiving the sender's request, the remittance transfer provider shall correct the error within one business day, or as soon as reasonably practicable, applying the same exchange rate, fees, and taxes stated in the disclosure provided under \u00a7 1005.31(b)(2) or (3), if the sender requests delivery of the amount appropriate to correct the error and the error did not occur because the sender provided incorrect or insufficient information. The provider may also request that the sender indicate the preferred remedy at the time the sender provides notice of the error although if provider does so, it should indicate that the if the sender chooses a resend at the time, the remedy may be unavailable if the error occurred because the sender provided incorrect or insufficient information. However, if the sender does not indicate the desired remedy at the time of providing notice of error, the remittance transfer provider must notify the sender of any available remedies in the report provided under \u00a7 1005.33(c)(1) or (d)(1) if the provider determines an error occurred.\r\n\r\n{33-c-Interp-4}\r\n4. *Default remedy.* Unless the sender provided incorrect or insufficient information and \u00a7 1005.33(c)(2)(iii) applies, the remittance transfer provider may set a default remedy that the provider will provide if the sender does not designate a remedy within a reasonable time after the sender receives the report provided under \u00a7 1005.33(c)(1). A provider that permits a sender to designate a remedy within 10 days after the provider has sent the report provided under \u00a7 1005.33(c)(1) or (d)(1) before imposing the default remedy is deemed to have provided the sender with a reasonable time to designate a remedy. In the case a default remedy is provided, the provider must correct the error within one business day, or as soon as reasonably practicable, after the reasonable time for the sender to designate the remedy has passed, consistent with \u00a7 1005.33(c)(2).\r\n\r\n{33-c-Interp-5}\r\n5. *Amount appropriate to resolve the error.* For purposes of the remedies set forth in \u00a7 1005.33(c)(2)(i)(A), (c)(2)(i)(B), (c)(2)(ii)(A)( *1*), and (c)(2)(i)(A)( *2*) the amount appropriate to resolve the error is the specific amount of transferred funds that should have been received if the remittance transfer had been effected without error. The amount appropriate to resolve the error does not include consequential damages. For example, when the amount that was disclosed pursuant to \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1)(vii) was received by the designated recipient before the provider must determine the appropriate remedy for an error under \u00a7 1005.33(a)(1)(iv), no additional amounts are required to resolve the error after the remittance transfer provider refunds the appropriate fees and taxes paid by the sender pursuant to \u00a7 1005.33(c)(2)(ii)(B) or (c)(2)(iii), as applicable.\r\n\r\n{33-c-Interp-6}\r\n6. *Form of refund.* For a refund provided under \u00a7 1005.33(c)(2)(i)(A), (c)(2)(ii)(A)( *1*), (c)(2)(ii)(B), or (c)(2)(iii), a remittance transfer provider may generally, at its discretion, issue a refund either in cash or in the same form of payment that was initially provided by the sender for the remittance transfer. For example, if the sender originally provided a credit card as payment for the transfer, the remittance transfer provider may issue a credit to the sender's credit card account in the appropriate amount. However, if a sender initially provided cash for the remittance transfer, a provider may issue a refund by check. For example, if the sender originally provided cash as payment for the transfer, the provider may mail a check to the sender in the amount of the payment.\r\n\r\n{33-c-Interp-7}\r\n7. *Remedies for incorrect amount paid.* If an error under \u00a7 1005.33(a)(1)(i) occurred, the sender may request the remittance transfer provider refund the amount necessary to resolve the error under \u00a7 1005.33(c)(2)(i)(A) or that the remittance transfer provider make the amount necessary to resolve the error available to the designated recipient at no additional cost under \u00a7 1005.33(c)(2)(i)(B).\r\n\r\n{33-c-Interp-8}\r\n8. *Correction of an error if funds not available by disclosed date.* If the remittance transfer provider determines an error of failure to make funds available by the disclosed date occurred under \u00a7 1005.33(a)(1)(iv), it must correct the error in accordance with \u00a7 1005.33(c)(2)(ii)(A), as applicable, and refund any fees imposed for the transfer (unless the sender provided incorrect or insufficient information to the remittance transfer provider in connection with the remittance transfer), whether the fee was imposed by the provider or a third party involved in sending the transfer, such as an intermediary bank involved in sending a wire transfer or the institution from which the funds are picked up in accordance with \u00a7 1005.33(c)(2)(ii)(B).\r\n\r\n{33-c-Interp-9}\r\n9. *Charges for error resolution.* If an error occurred, whether as alleged or in a different amount or manner, the remittance transfer provider may not impose a charge related to any aspect of the error resolution process (including charges for documentation or investigation).\r\n\r\n{33-c-Interp-10}\r\n10. *Correction without investigation.* A remittance transfer provider may correct an error, without investigation, in the amount or manner alleged by the sender, or otherwise determined, to be in error, but must comply with all other applicable requirements of \u00a7 1005.33.\r\n\r\n{33-c-Interp-11}\r\n11. *Procedure for sending a new remittance transfer after a sender provides incorrect or insufficient information.* Section 1005.33(c)(2)(iii) generally requires a remittance transfer provider to refund the transfer amount to the sender even if the sender's previously designated remedy was a resend or if the provider's default remedy in other circumstances is a resend. However, if before the refund is processed, the sender receives notice pursuant to \u00a7 1005.33(c)(1) or (d)(1) that an error occurred because the sender provided incorrect or insufficient information and then requests that the provider send the remittance transfer again, and the provider agrees to that request, \u00a7 1005.33(c)(2)(iii) requires that the request be treated as a new remittance transfer and the provider must provide new disclosures in accordance with \u00a7 1005.31 and all other applicable provisions of subpart B. However, \u00a7 1005.33(c)(2)(iii) does not obligate the provider to agree to a sender's request to send a new remittance transfer.\r\n\r\n{33-c-Interp-12}\r\n12. *Determining amount of refund.* Section 1005.33(c)(2)(iii) permits the provider to deduct from the amount refunded, or applied towards a new transfer, any fees or taxes actually deducted from the transfer amount by a person other than the provider as part of the first unsuccessful remittance transfer attempt or that were deducted in the course of returning the transfer amount to the provider following a failed delivery. However, a provider may not deduct those fees and taxes that will ultimately be refunded to the provider. When the provider deducts fees or taxes from the amount refunded pursuant to \u00a7 1005.33(c)(2)(iii), the provider must inform the sender of the deduction as part of the notice required by either \u00a7 1005.33(c)(1) or (d)(1) and the reason for the deduction. The following examples illustrate these concepts.\r\n\r\n{33-c-Interp-12-i}\r\ni. A sender instructs a remittance transfer provider to send US$100 to a designated recipient in local currency, for which the provider charges a transfer fee of US$10 (and thus the sender pays the provider $110). The provider's correspondent imposes a fee of US$15 that it deducts from the amount of the transfer. The sender provides incorrect or insufficient information that results in non-delivery of the remittance transfer as requested. Once the provider determines that an error occurred because the sender provided incorrect or insufficient information, the provider must provide the report required by \u00a7 1005.33(c)(1) or (d)(1) and inform the sender, pursuant to \u00a7 1005.33(c)(1) or (d)(1), that it will refund US$95 to the sender within three business days, unless the sender chooses to apply the US$95 towards a new remittance transfer and the provider agrees. Of the $95 that is refunded to the sender, $10 reflects the refund of the provider's transfer fee, and $85 reflects the refund of the amount of funds provided by the sender in connection with the transfer which was not properly transmitted. The provider is not required to refund the US$15 fee imposed by the correspondent (unless the $15 will be refunded to the provider by the correspondent).\r\n\r\n{33-c-Interp-12-ii}\r\nii. A sender instructs a remittance transfer provider to send US$100 to a designated recipient in a foreign country, for which the provider charges a transfer fee of US$10 (and thus the sender pays the provider US$110) and an intermediary institution charges a lifting fee of US$5, such that the designated recipient is expected to receive only US$95, as indicated in the receipt. If an error occurs because the sender provides incorrect or insufficient information that results in non-delivery of the remittance transfer by the date of availability stated in the disclosure provided to the sender for the remittance transfer under \u00a7 1005.31(b)(2) or (3), the provider is required to refund, or reapply if requested and the provider agrees, $105 unless the intermediary institution refunds to the provider the US$5 fee. If the sender requests to have the transfer amount applied to a new remittance transfer pursuant to \u00a7 1005.33(c)(2)(iii) and provides the corrected or additional information, and the remittance transfer provider agrees to a resend remedy, the remittance transfer provider may charge the sender another transfer fee of US$10 to send the remittance transfer again with the corrected or additional information necessary to complete the transfer. Insofar as the resend is an entirely new remittance transfer, the provider must provide a prepayment disclosure and receipt or combined disclosure in accordance with, among other provisions, the timing requirements of \u00a7 1005.31(f) and the cancellation provision of \u00a7 1005.34(a).\r\n\r\n{33-c-Interp-12-iii}\r\niii. In connection with a remittance transfer, a provider imposes a $15 tax that it then remits to a State taxing authority. An error occurs because the sender provided incorrect or insufficient information that resulted in non-delivery of the transfer to the designated recipient. The provider may deduct $15 from the amount it refunds to the sender pursuant to \u00a7 1005.33(c)(2)(iii) unless the relevant tax law will result in the $15 tax being refunded to the provider by the State taxing authority because the transfer was not completed.\r\n\r\n{33-d-Interp}\r\n#### 33(d) Procedures if Remittance Transfer Provider Determines No Error or Different Error Occurred\r\n\r\n{33-d-Interp-1}\r\n1. *Error different from that alleged.* When a remittance transfer provider determines that an error occurred in a manner or amount different from that described by the sender, it must comply with the requirements of both \u00a7 1005.33(c) and (d), as applicable. The provider may give the notice of correction and the explanation separately or in a combined form.\r\n\r\n{33-e-Interp}\r\n#### 33(e) Reassertion of Error\r\n\r\n{33-e-Interp-1}\r\n1. *Withdrawal of error; right to reassert.* The remittance transfer provider has no further error resolution responsibilities if the sender voluntarily withdraws the notice alleging an error. A sender who has withdrawn an allegation of error has the right to reassert the allegation unless the remittance transfer provider had already complied with all of the error resolution requirements before the allegation was withdrawn. The sender must do so, however, within the original 180-day period from the disclosed date of availability or, if applicable, the 60-day period for a notice of error asserted pursuant to \u00a7 1005.33(b)(2).\r\n\r\n{33-f-Interp}\r\n#### 33(f) Relation to Other Laws\r\n\r\n{33-f-Interp-1}\r\n1. *Concurrent error obligations.* A financial institution that is also the remittance transfer provider may have error obligations under both \u00a7\u00a7 1005.11 and 1005.33. For example, if a sender asserts an error under \u00a7 1005.11 with a remittance transfer provider that holds the sender's account, and the error is not also an error under \u00a7 1005.33 (such as the omission of an EFT on a periodic statement), then the error-resolution provisions of \u00a7 1005.11 exclusively apply to the error. However, if a sender asserts an error under \u00a7 1005.33 with a remittance transfer provider that holds the sender's account, and the error is also an error under \u00a7 1005.11 (such as when the amount the sender requested to be deducted from the sender's account and sent for the remittance transfer differs from the amount that was actually deducted from the account and sent), then the error-resolution provisions of \u00a7 1005.33 exclusively apply to the error.\r\n\r\n{33-f-Interp-2}\r\n2. *Holder in due course.* Nothing in this section limits a sender's rights to assert claims and defenses against a card issuer concerning property or services purchased with a credit card under Regulation Z, 12 CFR 1026.12(c)(1), as applicable.\r\n\r\n{33-f-Interp-3}\r\n3. *Assertion of same error with multiple parties.* If a sender receives credit to correct an error of an incorrect amount paid in connection with a remittance transfer from either the remittance transfer provider or account-holding institution (or creditor), and subsequently asserts the same error with another party, that party has no further responsibilities to investigate the error if the error has been corrected. For example, assume that a sender initially asserts an error with a remittance transfer provider with respect to a remittance transfer alleging that US$130 was debited from his checking account, but the sender only requested a remittance transfer for US$100, plus a US$10 transfer fee. If the remittance transfer provider refunds US$20 to the sender to correct the error, and the sender subsequently asserts the same error with his account-holding institution, the account-holding institution has no error resolution responsibilities under Regulation E because the error has been fully corrected. In addition, nothing in this section prevents an account-holding institution or creditor from reversing amounts it has previously credited to correct an error if a sender receives more than one credit to correct the same error. For example, assume that a sender concurrently asserts an error with his or her account-holding institution and remittance transfer provider for the same error, and the sender receives credit from the account-holding institution for the error within 45 days of the notice of error. If the remittance transfer provider subsequently provides a credit of the same amount to the sender for the same error, the account-holding institution may reverse the amounts it had previously credited to the consumer's account, even after the 45-day error resolution period under \u00a7 1005.11.\r\n\r\n{33-g-Interp}\r\n#### 33(g) Error Resolution Standards and Recordkeeping Requirements\r\n\r\n{33-g-Interp-1}\r\n1. *Record retention requirements.* As noted in \u00a7 1005.33(g)(2), remittance transfer providers are subject to the record retention requirements under \u00a7 1005.13. Therefore, remittance transfer providers must retain documentation, including documentation related to error investigations, for a period of not less than two years from the date a notice of error was submitted to the provider or action was required to be taken by the provider. A remittance transfer provider need not maintain records of individual disclosures that it has provided to each sender; it need only retain evidence demonstrating that its procedures reasonably ensure the sender's receipt of required disclosures and documentation.\r\n\r\n{33-h-Interp}\r\n#### 33(h) Incorrect Account Number Supplied\r\n\r\n{33-h-Interp-1}\r\n1. *Reasonable methods of verification.* When a sender provides an incorrect recipient institution identifier, \u00a7 1005.33(h)(2) limits the exception in \u00a7 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(D) to situations where the provider used reasonably available means to verify that the recipient institution identifier provided by the sender did correspond to the recipient institution name provided by the sender. Reasonably available means may include accessing a directory of Business Identifier Codes and verifying that the code provided by the sender matches the provided institution name, and, if possible, the specific branch or location provided by the sender. Providers may also rely on other commercially available databases or directories to check other recipient institution identifiers. If reasonable verification means fail to identify that the recipient institution identifier is incorrect, the exception in \u00a7 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(D) will apply, assuming that the provider can satisfy the other conditions in \u00a7 1005.33(h). Similarly, if no reasonably available means exist to verify the accuracy of the recipient institution identifier, \u00a7 1005.33(h)(2) would be satisfied and thus the exception in \u00a7 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(D) also will apply, again assuming the provider can satisfy the other conditions in \u00a7 1005.33(h). However, where a provider does not employ reasonably available means to verify a recipient institution identifier, \u00a7 1005.33(h)(2) is not satisfied and the exception in \u00a7 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(D) will not apply.\r\n\r\n{33-h-Interp-2}\r\n2. *Reasonable efforts.* Section 1005.33(h)(5) requires a remittance transfer provider to use reasonable efforts to recover the amount that was to be received by the designated recipient. Whether a provider has used reasonable efforts does not depend on whether the provider is ultimately successful in recovering the amount that was to be received by the designated recipient. Under \u00a7 1005.33(h)(5), if the remittance transfer provider is requested to provide documentation or other supporting information in order for the pertinent institution or authority to obtain the proper authorization for the return of the incorrectly credited amount, reasonable efforts to recover the amount include timely providing any such documentation to the extent that it is available and permissible under law. The following are examples of reasonable efforts:\r\n\r\n{33-h-Interp-2-i}\r\ni. The remittance transfer provider promptly calls or otherwise contacts the institution that received the transfer, either directly or indirectly through any correspondent(s) or other intermediaries or service providers used for the particular transfer, to request that the amount that was to be received by the designated recipient be returned, and if required by law or contract, by requesting that the recipient institution obtain a debit authorization from the holder of the incorrectly credited account.\r\n\r\n{33-h-Interp-2-ii}\r\nii. The remittance transfer provider promptly uses a messaging service through a funds transfer system to contact institution that received the transfer, either directly or indirectly through any correspondent(s) or other intermediaries or service providers used for the particular transfer, to request that the amount that was to be received by the designated recipient be returned, in accordance with the messaging service's rules and protocol, and if required by law or contract, by requesting that the recipient institution obtain a debit authorization from the holder of the incorrectly credited account.\r\n\r\n{33-h-Interp-3}\r\n3. *Promptness of Reasonable Efforts.* Section 1005.33(h)(5) requires that a remittance transfer provider act promptly in using reasonable efforts to recover the amount that was to be received by the designated recipient. Whether a provider acts promptly to use reasonable efforts depends on the facts and circumstances. For example, if, before the date of availability disclosed pursuant to \u00a7 1005.31(b)(2)(ii), the sender informs the provider that the sender provided a mistaken account number, the provider will have acted promptly if it attempts to contact the recipient's institution before the date of availability.\r\n\r\n",

For example, the sender could provide the confirmation number or code that would be used by the designated recipient to pick up the transfer or other identification number or code supplied by the remittance transfer provider in connection with the transfer, if such number or code is sufficient for the remittance transfer provider to identify the transfer. A remittance transfer provider may also request, or the sender may provide, the sender's email address instead of a physical address, so long as the remittance transfer provider is able to identify the transfer to which the request to cancel applies.\r\n\r\n{34-a-Interp-2}\r\n2. *Notice of cancellation right.* Section 1005.31 requires a remittance transfer provider to include an abbreviated notice of the sender's right to cancel a remittance transfer on the receipt or combined disclosure given under \u00a7 1005.31(b)(2) or (3). In addition, the remittance transfer provider must make available to a sender upon request, a notice providing a full description of the right to cancel a remittance transfer using language that is set forth in Model Form A-36 of Appendix A to this part or substantially similar language.\r\n\r\n{34-a-Interp-3}\r\n3. *Thirty-minute cancellation right.* A remittance transfer provider must comply with the cancellation and refund requirements of \u00a7 1005.34 if the cancellation request is received by the provider no later than 30 minutes after the sender makes payment. The provider may, at its option, provide a longer time period for cancellation. A provider must provide the 30-minute cancellation right regardless of the provider's normal business hours. For example, if an agent closes less than 30 minutes after the sender makes payment, the provider could opt to take cancellation requests through the telephone number disclosed on the receipt. The provider could also set a cutoff time after which the provider will not accept requests to send a remittance transfer. For example, a financial institution that closes at 5:00 p.m. could stop accepting payment for remittance transfers after 4:30 p.m.\r\n\r\n{34-a-Interp-4}\r\n4. *Cancellation request provided to agent.* A cancellation request provided by a sender to an agent of the remittance transfer provider is deemed to be received by the provider under \u00a7 1005.34(a) when received by the agent.\r\n\r\n{34-a-Interp-5}\r\n5. *Payment made.* For purposes of subpart B, payment is made, for example, when a sender provides cash to the remittance transfer provider or when payment is authorized.\r\n\r\n{34-b-Interp}\r\n#### 34(b) Time Limits and Refund Requirements\r\n\r\n{34-b-Interp-1}\r\n1. *Form of refund.* At its discretion, a remittance transfer provider generally may issue a refund either in cash or in the same form of payment that was initially provided by the sender for the remittance transfer. For example, if the sender originally provided a credit card as payment for the transfer, the remittance transfer provider may issue a credit to the sender's credit card account in the amount of the payment. However, if a sender initially provided cash for the remittance transfer, a provider may issue a refund by check. For example, if the sender originally provided cash as payment for the transfer, the provider may mail a check to the sender in the amount of the payment.\r\n\r\n{34-b-Interp-2}\r\n2. *Fees and taxes refunded.* If a sender provides a timely request to cancel a remittance transfer, a remittance transfer provider must refund all funds provided by the sender in connection with the remittance transfer, including any fees and, to the extent not prohibited by law, taxes that have been imposed for the transfer, whether the fee or tax was assessed by the provider or a third party, such as an intermediary institution, the agent or bank in the recipient country, or a State or other governmental body.\r\n",

        "contents": "\r\n{36-Interp}\r\n### Section 1005.36 - Transfers Scheduled Before the Date of Transfer\r\n\r\n{36-Interp-1}\r\n1. *Applicability of subpart B.* The requirements set forth in subpart B apply to remittance transfers subject to \u00a7 1005.36, to the extent that \u00a7 1005.36 does not modify those requirements. For example, the foreign language disclosure requirements in \u00a7 1005.31(g) and related commentary continue to apply to disclosures provided in accordance with \u00a7 1005.36(a)(2).\r\n\r\n{36-a-Interp}\r\n#### 36(a) Timing\r\n\r\n{36-a-2-Interp}\r\n#### 36(a)(2) Subsequent Preauthorized Remittance Transfers\r\n\r\n{36-a-2-Interp-1}\r\n1. *Changes in Disclosures.* When a sender schedules a series of preauthorized remittance transfers, the provider is generally not required to provide a pre-payment disclosure prior to the date of each subsequent transfer. However, \u00a7 1005.36(a)(1)(i) requires the provider to provide a pre-payment disclosure and receipt for the first in the series of preauthorized remittance transfers in accordance with the timing requirements set forth in \u00a7 1005.31(e). While certain information in those disclosures is expressly permitted to be estimated (see \u00a7 1005.32(b)(2)), other information is not permitted to be estimated, or is limited in how it may be estimated. When any of the information on the most recent receipt provided pursuant to \u00a7 1005.36(a)(1)(i) or (a)(2)(i), other than the temporal disclosures required by \u00a7 1005.31(b)(2)(ii) and (b)(2)(vii), is no longer accurate with respect to a subsequent preauthorized remittance transfer for reasons other than as permitted by \u00a7 1005.32, the provider must provide, within a reasonable time prior to the scheduled date of the next preauthorized remittance transfer, a receipt that complies with \u00a7 1005.31(b)(2) and which discloses, among the other disclosures required by \u00a7 1005.31(b)(2), the changed terms. For example, if the provider discloses in the pre-payment disclosure for the first in the series of preauthorized remittance transfers that its fee for each remittance transfer is $20 and, after six preauthorized remittance transfers, the provider increases its fee to $30 (to the extent permitted by contract law), the provider must provide the sender a receipt that complies with \u00a7\u00a7 1005.31(b)(2) and 1005.36(b)(2) within a reasonable time prior to the seventh transfer. Barring a further change, this receipt will apply to transfers after the seventh transfer. Or, if, after the sixth transfer, a tax collected by the provider increases from 1.5% of the amount that will be transferred to the designated recipient to 2.0% of the amount that will be transferred to the designated recipient, the provider must provide the sender a receipt that complies with \u00a7\u00a7 1005.31(b)(2) and 1005.36(b)(2) within a reasonable time prior to the seventh transfer. In contrast, \u00a7 1005.36(a)(2)(i) does not require an updated receipt where an exchange rate, estimated as permitted by \u00a7 1005.32(b)(2), changes.\r\n\r\n{36-a-2-Interp-2}\r\n2. *Clearly and conspicuously.* In order to indicate clearly and conspicuously that the provider's fee has changed as required by \u00a7 1005.36(a)(2)(i), the provider could, for example, state on the receipt: \u201cTransfer Fees (UPDATED) * * * $30.\u201d To the extent that other figures on the receipt must be revised because of the new fee, the receipt should also indicate that those figures are updated.\r\n\r\n{36-a-2-Interp-3}\r\n3. *Reasonable time.* If a disclosure required by \u00a7 1005.36(a)(2)(i) or (d)(1) is mailed, the disclosure would be considered to be received by the sender five business days after it is posted in the mail. If hand delivered or provided electronically, the receipt would be considered to be received by the sender at the time of delivery. Thus, if the provider mails a disclosure required by \u00a7 1005.36(a)(2)(i) or (d)(1) not later than ten business days before the scheduled date of the transfer, or hand or electronically delivers a disclosure not later than five business days before the scheduled date of the transfer, the provider would be deemed to have provided the disclosure within a reasonable time prior to the scheduled date of the subsequent preauthorized remittance transfer.\r\n\r\n{36-b-Interp}\r\n#### 36(b) Accuracy\r\n\r\n{36-b-Interp-1}\r\n1. *Use of estimates.* In providing the disclosures described in \u00a7 1005.36(a)(1)(i) or (a)(2)(i), remittance transfer providers may use estimates to the extent permitted by any of the exceptions in \u00a7 1005.32. When estimates are permitted, however, they must be disclosed in accordance with \u00a7 1005.31(d).\r\n\r\n{36-b-Interp-2}\r\n2. *Subsequent preauthorized remittance transfers.* For a subsequent transfer in a series of preauthorized remittance transfers, the receipt provided pursuant to \u00a7 1005.36(a)(1)(i), except for the temporal disclosures in that receipt required by \u00a7 1005.31(b)(2)(ii) (Date Available) and (b)(2)(vii) (Transfer Date), applies to each subsequent preauthorized remittance transfer unless and until it is superseded by a receipt provided pursuant to \u00a7 1005.36(a)(2)(i). For each subsequent preauthorized remittance transfer, only the most recent receipt provided pursuant to \u00a7 1005.36(a)(1)(i) or (a)(2)(i) must be accurate as of the date each subsequent transfer is made.\r\n\r\n{36-b-Interp-3}\r\n3. *Receipts.* A receipt required by \u00a7 1005.36(a)(1)(ii) or (a)(2)(ii) must accurately reflect the details of the transfer to which it pertains and may not contain estimates pursuant to \u00a7 1005.32(b)(2). However, the remittance transfer provider may continue to disclose estimates to the extent permitted by \u00a7 1005.32(a) or (b)(1). In providing receipts pursuant to \u00a7 1005.36(a)(1)(ii) or (a)(2)(ii), \u00a7 1005.36(b)(2) and (3) do not allow a remittance transfer provider to change figures previously disclosed on a receipt provided pursuant to \u00a7 1005.36(a)(1)(i) or (a)(2)(i), unless a figure was an estimate or based on an estimate disclosed pursuant to \u00a7 1005.32. Thus, for example, if a provider disclosed its fee as $10 in a receipt provided pursuant to \u00a7 1005.36(a)(1)(i) and that receipt contained an estimate of the exchange rate pursuant to \u00a7 1005.32(b)(2), the second receipt provided pursuant to \u00a7 1005.36(a)(1)(ii) must also disclose the fee as $10.\r\n\r\n{36-c-Interp}\r\n#### 36(c) Cancellation\r\n\r\n{36-c-Interp-1}\r\n1. *Scheduled remittance transfer.* Section 1005.36(c) applies when a remittance transfer is scheduled by the sender at least three business days before the date of the transfer, whether the sender schedules a preauthorized remittance transfer or a one-time transfer. A remittance transfer is scheduled if it will require no further action by the sender to send the transfer after the sender requests the transfer. For example, a remittance transfer is scheduled at least three business days before the date of the transfer, and \u00a7 1005.36(c) applies, where a sender on March 1 requests a remittance transfer provider to send a wire transfer to pay a bill in a foreign country on March 15, if it will require no further action by the sender to send the transfer after the sender requests the transfer. A remittance transfer is not scheduled, and \u00a7 1005.36(c) does not apply, where a transfer occurs more than three days after the date the sender requests the transfer solely due to the provider's processing time. The following are examples of when a sender has not scheduled a remittance transfer at least three business days before the date of the remittance transfer, such that the cancellation rule in \u00a7 1005.34 applies.\r\n\r\n{36-c-Interp-1-i}\r\ni. A sender on March 1 requests a remittance transfer provider to send a wire transfer to pay a bill in a foreign country on March 3.\r\n\r\n{36-c-Interp-1-ii}\r\nii. A sender on March 1 requests that a remittance transfer provider send a remittance transfer on March 15, but the provider requires the sender to confirm the request on March 14 in order to send the transfer.\r\n\r\n{36-c-Interp-1-iii}\r\niii. A sender on March 1 requests that a remittance transfer provider send an ACH transfer, and that transfer is sent on March 2, but due to the time required for processing, funds will not be deducted from the sender's account until March 5.\r\n\r\n{36-c-Interp-2}\r\n2. *Cancelled preauthorized remittance transfers.* For preauthorized remittance transfers, the provider must assume the request to cancel applies to all future preauthorized remittance transfers, unless the sender specifically indicates that it should apply only to the next scheduled remittance transfer.\r\n\r\n{36-c-Interp-3}\r\n3. *Concurrent cancellation obligations.* A financial institution that is also a remittance transfer provider may have both stop payment obligations under \u00a7 1005.10 and cancellation obligations under \u00a7 1005.36. If a sender cancels a remittance transfer under \u00a7 1005.36 with a remittance transfer provider that holds the sender's account, and the transfer is a preauthorized transfer under \u00a7 1005.10, then the cancellation provisions of \u00a7 1005.36 exclusively apply.\r\n\r\n{36-d-Interp}\r\n#### 36(d) Date of Transfer for Subsequent Preauthorized Remittance Transfers\r\n\r\n{36-d-Interp-1}\r\n1. *General.* Section 1005.36(d)(2)(i) permits remittance transfer providers some flexibility in determining how and when the disclosures required by \u00a7 1005.36(d)(1) may be provided to senders. The disclosure described in \u00a7 1005.36(d)(1) may be provided as a separate disclosure, or on or with any other disclosure required by this subpart B related to the same series of preauthorized remittance transfers, provided that the disclosure and timing requirements in \u00a7 1005.36(d)(2) and other applicable provisions in subpart B are satisfied. For example, the required disclosures may be made on or with a receipt provided pursuant to \u00a7 1005.36(a)(1)(i); a receipt provided pursuant to \u00a7 1005.36(a)(2); or in a separate disclosure created by the provider. Thus, for example, a remittance transfer provider complies with \u00a7 1005.36(d)(1) for a period of one year if it provides in the receipt provided to the sender when payment is made for the initial preauthorized remittance transfer, a schedule or summary of the dates of transfer of all the subsequent preauthorized remittance transfers in the series scheduled to occur over the next 12 months (and the applicable cancellation requirements and contact information).\r\n\r\n{36-d-Interp-2}\r\n2. *Delivery of disclosure.* Section 1005.36(d)(2)(i) requires that the sender receive disclosure of the date of transfer, applicable cancellation requirements, and the provider's contact information no more than 12 months, and no less than 5 business days prior to the date of transfer of the subsequent preauthorized remittance transfer. For purposes of determining when a disclosure required by \u00a7 1005.36(d)(1) is received by the sender, refer to comment 36(a)(2)-3.\r\n\r\n{36-d-Interp-3}\r\n3. *Disclosure of the date of transfer.* The date of transfer of a subsequent preauthorized remittance transfer may be disclosed as a specific date ( *e.g.,* July 19, 2013) or by using a method that clearly permits identification of the date of the transfer, such as periodic intervals ( *e.g.,* the third Monday of every month, or the 15th of every month). If the future dates of transfer are disclosed as occurring periodically and there is a break in the sequence, or the date of transfer does not otherwise conform to the described period, *e.g.,* if a holiday or weekend causes the provider to deviate from the normal schedule, the remittance transfer provider should disclose the specific date of transfer for the affected transfer.\r\n\r\n{36-d-Interp-4}\r\n4. *Accuracy requirements.* Section 1005.36(d)(4) sets forth accuracy requirements for disclosures required for subsequent preauthorized remittance transfers under \u00a7 1005.36(d)(1). If any of the information provided in these disclosures change, the provider must provide an updated disclosure with the revised information that is accurate as of when the transfer is made, pursuant to \u00a7 1005.36(d)(2).\r\n",
