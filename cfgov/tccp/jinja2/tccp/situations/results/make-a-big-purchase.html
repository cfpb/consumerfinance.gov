    If you have carried balances in the past, or think you are likely to do so,
    consider credit cards that have the lowest interest rates.

    <strong>Did you know:</strong>
    If a card has a promotional interest, you have to keep track of how you are
    paying off that balance within the promotional period, or you could end up
    owing more in interest than the original purchase amount.
