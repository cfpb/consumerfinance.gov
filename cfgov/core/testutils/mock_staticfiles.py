class MockStaticfilesFinder(BaseFinder):
    """A Django Staticfiles finder backend that mocks certain files.

    This finder replaces requests for certain static files that don't exist
    with other static files that do.

    Depends on a MOCK_STATICFILES_PATTERNS setting that must contain a list of
    patterns to match and files to serve instead when those patterns are
    requested. Replacement files must be patterns that could ordinarily be
    served successfully by another staticfiles finder.

    For example, given this setting:

    MOCK_STATICFILES_PATTERNS = {
        'file.txt': 'some/other/file.txt',
        'path/to/images/*.jpg': 'some/other/image.jpg',
    }

    then a request to static('file.txt') that might otherwise fail (if not
    provided by other staticfiles finders) will instead delegate to a request
    to static('some/other/file.txt'). Similarly, a request that matches a
    wildcard, like static('path/to/images/foo.jpg') will be delegated to a
    request to static('some/other/image.jpg').

    If a given path matches more than one pattern, the replacement used is not
    guaranteed due to unpredictable dict sorting order.

    Warning: the Django docs currently say that "Static file finders are
    currently considered a private interface, and this interface is thus
    undocumented." Use at your own risk.
