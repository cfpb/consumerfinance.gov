                        The CFPB maintains a database
                        of credit card agreements from hundreds of card issuers.
                        Using the tool below,
                        you can search for an agreement by the name of the issuer.

                    This search method accesses all credit card agreements as of the CFPBâ€™s most recent quarterly collection of
                    credit card agreements. To access all agreements from the most recent or earlier periods, please click on the
                    relevant agreement link below. (Please note that the Bureau did not collect agreements for 2015. The January
                    2016 archive is a sample that was collected by Bureau staff from the publicly-available websites of the largest
                    credit card issuers as of the first week of January 2016, and does not constitute a full set of agreements).
                    Credit card issuers are generally required to post the credit card agreements that they offer to the public on
                    their websites, with limited exceptions.
                    If you are an issuer, email <a href="mailto:CardAgreements@consumerfinance.gov">CardAgreements@consumerfinance.gov</a>
                    for agreement submission instructions.

                <h3>Looking for your own credit card agreement?</h3>
                <p>
                    We have provided this database so you can search for agreements between
                    credit card issuers and their customers. The agreements in this database
                    have general terms and conditions, pricing, and fee information.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you are looking for information specific to your account,
                    contact the bank or institution that issued your card.
                    By law, the issuer must make your agreement available to you upon request.
                    If you are having trouble getting your agreement, let us know by
                    <a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/complaint/">submitting a complaint</a>.

                <p>
                    We have collected credit card issuer marketing agreements with
