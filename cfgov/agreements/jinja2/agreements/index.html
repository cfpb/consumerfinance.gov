                The CFPB maintains a database
                of credit card agreements from hundreds of card issuers.
                Using the tool below,
                you can search for an agreement by the name of the issuer.

          This search method accesses all credit card agreements as of the CFPB’s most recent quarterly collection of
          credit card agreements. To access all agreements from the most recent or earlier periods, please click on the
          relevant agreement link below. (Please note that the Bureau did not collect agreements for 2015. The January
          2016 archive is a sample that was collected by Bureau staff from the publicly-available websites of the largest
          credit card issuers as of the first week of January 2016, and does not constitute a full set of agreements).
          Credit card issuers are generally required to post the credit card agreements that they offer to the public on
          their websites, with limited exceptions.
          If you are an issuer, email <a href="mailto:CardAgreements@consumerfinance.gov">CardAgreements@consumerfinance.gov</a>
          for agreement submission instructions.

      <h3>Looking for your own credit card agreement?</h3>
      <p>
          We have provided this database so you can search for agreements between
          credit card issuers and their customers. The agreements in this database
          have general terms and conditions, pricing, and fee information.
      </p>
      <p>
          If you are looking for information specific to your account,
          contact the bank or institution that issued your card.
          By law, the issuer must make your agreement available to you upon request.
          If you are having trouble getting your agreement, let us know by
          <a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/complaint/">submitting a complaint</a>.
