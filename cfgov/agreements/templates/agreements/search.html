                We will display the consumer credit card agreements in this
                database as the respective issuers submitted them.
                The CFPB is not responsible for the content of the agreements,
                including any discrepancies between an agreement as presented
                in this database and the agreement as offered to the public,
                or for any omissions or other errors in the agreement
                as submitted by the issuer.
            </p>

            <p>
                The agreements on file will have general terms and conditions,
                pricing, and fee information. They are not
                specific to an individual's account information.
            </p>

            <p>
                If you have questions about the agreements themselves,
                contact the card issuer directly.

                    The drop-down list contains credit card issuers that have
                    submitted credit card agreements as required under
                    Section 204 of the Credit Card Accountability
                    Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009 (the CARD Act).
                    If you cannot find a card issuer, it may be that:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                      The issuer has not yet submitted its agreements
                      to the Federal Reserve Board;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      The issuer has fewer than 10,000 accounts and does not
                      have to submit its agreements; or
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      The name that you are looking for is not the actual
                      issuer's name
                      (for example, "ABC Card" is issued by XYZ Bank).
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    If none of these reasons apply and you still cannot find
                    an agreement, call them to request a copy of your agreement.
                    Under federal law, your credit card issuer is required to
                    provide a copy of your agreement upon request.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Look on the back of the credit card or on your latest
                    monthly statement to find the name of the issuer. The bank,
                    retailer, or other entity whose name appears on the front
                    of the card may not be the actual issuer of the card.
                    You can also check the issuer's website; typically,
                    the bank name is listed at the bottom of the issuer's
                    homepage.

                    The CARD Act is often called the
                    Credit Cardholders Bill of Rights.
                    President Obama signed the bill into law in May 2009.
                    Many of the most significant provisions of the law took
                    effect in February 2010.<br>
