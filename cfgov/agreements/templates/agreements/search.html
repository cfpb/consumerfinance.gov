				<p>The drop-down list contains credit card issuers that have submitted
					credit card agreements as required under Section 204 of the Credit Card
					Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009 (the CARD Act). If
					you cannot find a card issuer, it may be that:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>The issuer has not yet submitted its agreements to the Federal Reserve
						Board;
					</li>
					<li>The issuer has fewer than 10,000 accounts and does not have to submit
						its agreements; or
					<li>The name that you are looking for is not the actual issuer's name (for
						example, "ABC Card" is issued by XYZ Bank).
				</ul>

				<p>If none of these reasons apply and you still cannot find an agreement,
					call them to request a copy of your agreement. Under federal law, your
					credit card issuer is required to provide a copy of your agreement upon
					request.</p>

				<p>Look on the back of the credit card or on your latest monthly statement
					to find the name of the issuer. The bank, retailer, or other entity whose
					name appears on the front of the card may not be the actual issuer of the
					card. You can also check the issuer's website; typically, the bank name is
					listed at the bottom of the issuer's homepage.</p>
