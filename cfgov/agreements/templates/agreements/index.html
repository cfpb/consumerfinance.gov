<h1>Credit card agreement database</h1>

<div id="ccagrhome">
		<p>
        The CFPB maintains a database of credit card agreements from hundreds of card issuers.
            Using the tool below, you can search for an agreement by the name of the issuer.
		</p>

	  <h5>Show agreements by card issuer</h5>
    {% issuer_select %}

    <a href="#modIssuer" class="popl">Can't find an issuer?</a>
    <div id="modIssuer" class="modal closed" style="display: none;">
        <a href="#modIssuer" class="close">Close</a>

        <span><a href="#">Can't find an issuer?</a></span>
        <p>
            The drop-down list contains credit card issuers that have submitted
            credit card agreements as required under Section 204 of the
            Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009
            (the CARD Act).
        </p>
        <p>
            Look on the back of the credit card or on your latest monthly statement
            to find the name of the issuer. The bank, retailer, or other entity
            whose name appears on the front of the card may not be
            the actual issuer of the card. You can also check the issuer's website;
            typically, the bank name is listed at the bottom of the issuer's homepage.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you cannot find an agreement, call your issuer to request
            a copy of the agreement. Federal law requires your issuer to
            give you a copy of your agreement on request.
        </p>
    </div>

    <p>
        This search method accesses all credit card agreements as of the CFPBâ€™s most recent quarterly collection of
        credit card agreements. To access all agreements from the most recent or earlier periods, please click on the
        relevant agreement link below. (Please note that the Bureau did not collect agreements for 2015. The January
        2016 archive is a sample that was collected by Bureau staff from the publicly-available websites of the largest
        credit card issuers as of the first week of January 2016, and does not constitute a full set of agreements).
        Credit card issuers are generally required to post the credit card agreements that they offer to the public on
        their websites, with limited exceptions.
        If you are an issuer, email <a href="mailto:CardAgreements@consumerfinance.gov">CardAgreements@consumerfinance.gov</a>
        for agreement submission instructions.
