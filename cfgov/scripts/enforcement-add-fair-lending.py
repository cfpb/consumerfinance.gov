# This is a one-time script which can be deleted after running. March 2021.
# This script executes a data migration to make a correction to Enforcement
# Action Pages. It adds "fair lending" to the list of products on any page
# that had "fair lending" as an at-risk group and makes other corrections to
# the product list for enforcement action pages.
# Prerequisite: Run the migration that adds "fair lending" as a product choice
