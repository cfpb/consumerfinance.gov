            <p>By submitting a complaint, consumers can be heard by financial companies, get help with their own issues, and help others avoid similar ones. Every complaint provides insight into problems that people are experiencing,  helping us identify inappropriate practices and allowing us to stop them before they become major issues. The result: better outcomes for consumers, and a better financial marketplace for everyone.</p>

              Recent changes to the Consumer Complaint Database
            </h3>
            <p>
              In April 2017 we updated the form consumers use to submit complaints. The changes include making some plain language improvements and reorganizing how products, sub-products, issues, and sub-issues are grouped.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Consumer Complaint Database shows the consumer’s original product, sub-product, issue, and sub-issue selections consistent with the options available on the form at the time the consumer submitted the complaint.

              <p>The Consumer Complaint Database is a collection of complaints on a range of consumer financial products and services, sent to companies for response. We don’t verify all the facts alleged in these complaints, but we take steps to confirm a commercial relationship between the consumer and the company. <span class="publication-criteria"><a class="list_link icon-link icon-link__download" href="https://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/201303_cfpb_Final-Policy-Statement-Disclosure-of-Consumer-Complaint-Data.pdf">

              </a></span></p>
              <p>Since we started accepting complaints in July 2011, we’ve helped consumers connect with financial companies to understand issues with their mortgages, fix errors on their credit reports, stop harassment from debt collectors, and get direct responses about problems with their credit cards, checking and savings accounts, student loans, and more. We analyze the data to identify trends and problems in the marketplace to help us do a better job supervising companies, enforcing federal consumer financial laws and writing rules and regulations. We publish reports on complaints and share information with state and federal agencies.</p>

              </ul>
              <p>The database generally updates daily, and contains certain information for each complaint, including the source of the complaint, the date of submission, and the company the complaint was sent to for response. The database also includes information about the actions taken by the company in response to the complaint, such as, whether the company’s response was timely and how the company responded. If the consumer opts to share it and after we take steps to remove personal information, we publish the consumer’s description of what happened. Companies also have the option to select a public response. Company level information should be considered in context of company size and/or market share. Complaints referred to other regulators, such as complaints about depository institutions with less than $10 billion in assets, are not published in the Consumer Complaint Database.</p>
