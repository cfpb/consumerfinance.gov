    <h3>Inquiry into student loan servicing</h3>
    <p>In response to our public inquiry into student loan servicing practices, we received over 30,000 comments from the public, highlighting the costly surprises and runarounds some borrowers face when dealing with their servicers. We documented these widespread servicing failures reported by borrowers in our recent report, <a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/data-research/research-reports/student-loan-servicing/">Student Loan Servicing</a>.</p>
    <p>We also joined the Department of Education and the Department of the Treasury to issue a series of joint principles that offers a roadmap to <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.consumerfinance.gov/f/201509_cfpb_treasury_education-joint-statement-of-principles-on-student-loan-servicing.pdf">strengthen the student loan servicing market for all borrowers</a>.</p>
