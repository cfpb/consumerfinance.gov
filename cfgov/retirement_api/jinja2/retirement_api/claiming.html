                    Your decision of when to claim your Social Security could affect
                    the benefits your spouse will receive after you die. Surviving
                    spouses can keep either their own benefit or choose to keep
                    their spouse's benefit, whichever is higher. If you are married,
                    and are the higher earner in the household, claiming at your
                    full benefit age will ensure your spouse will receive the higher
                    benefit. Talk to your spouse about your claiming options so you
                    can make this important decision together.

                    If you claim at your full Social Security benefit age or later,

                    if you choose to wait to claim past your full benefit age until
                    age 70, you can get an increase for every month that you wait.
                    If you are divorced, your former spouse's claiming decision will
                    not affect your benefit, so it should not affect your decision
                    of when to claim.

                    You may qualify for a survivor benefit if your deceased spouse
                    qualified for Social Security. You can wait until age 70 to
                    claim your survivor benefit and get the maximum amount possible,
                    or you can claim a reduced survivor benefit as early as age 60.
                    You may also qualify for a retirement benefit based on your own
                    earnings record, but you will only receive one benefit at a
                    time. If you expect your own retirement benefit to be higher
                    than the survivor benefit, you may want to consider claiming
                    the survivor benefit first. That way, you can start receiving
                    some money from Social Security as your own retirement benefit
                    continues to grow.

                    Social Security won't replace all of your pre-retirement income.
                    On average, Social Security replaces 40 percent of a worker's
                    income. That means your retirement savings, pension

                    Security benefit age or later (up to age 70) can minimize this
                    gap and maximize your monthly benefit. If you claim before your
                    full retirement age, your monthly benefit could be reduced by as
                    much as 30 percent.

                    If you can, get the highest monthly Social Security benefit

                    Lastly, avoid losing your retirement savings to unnecessary tax

                    59½, you will likely face an early withdrawal penalty.

                    You may be able to save through your employer's retirement plan or
                    an Individual Retirement Account (IRA
                    <span data-tooltip-target="iras">

                    </span>).
                    Maximize an employer match if one is offered. This will help you
                    grow your retirement savings faster. You can also make additional
                    contributions to these accounts called catch-up contributions

                    Your decision about when to claim your Social Security benefits is
                    especially important if you cannot or did not save as much as you
                    would like. When you claim at your full Social Security benefit
                    age or later, you avoid a reduction in your monthly benefit. You
                    will also get increases for every month that you wait to claim
                    past your full benefit age until age 70.

                    Because Social Security provides guaranteed income for life, it's
                    especially valuable to you when you reach age 80 and beyond.
                    Claiming benefits at your full Social Security benefit age or
                    later could be a good way to secure your monthly income during
                    your later years. Your benefit increases the longer you wait to
                    claim, up to age 70, and is adjusted annually with the cost of
                    living. If you live into your 80s but claim at age 62 instead of
                    your full retirement age or later, your total lifetime benefits
                    will be lower by thousands of dollars.

                    We understand it's difficult to make predictions. You may want to
                    plan for the possibility that you (or your spouse) may spend 20
                    or more years in retirement. On average, a woman reaching age 65
                    today will live to age 87, and a man will live to age 84. Waiting
                    to claim as long as you can could still make sense for you if you
                    are married, are the higher earner in the household, and want your
                    surviving spouse to keep the highest monthly benefit after you
                    die. Remember, you can claim at any point between age 62 and 70.
                    Each additional month that you wait to claim gives you a permanent
                    increase in your monthly benefit which becomes more valuable as
                    you age.
