            As required by law, each fiscal quarter the Federal Reserve transfers
            to the CFPB the amount of funding formally requested by the Director of the CFPB
            in order to carry out Bureau activities as outlined in our budget. Once the funds are transferred,
            the Bureau receives an acknowledgement letter from the Federal Reserve Board.
