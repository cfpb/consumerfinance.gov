# cfgov-refresh

The in-progress redesign of the [consumerfinance.gov](http://consumerfinance.gov) website.
This project includes the front-end assets and build tools,
[Jinja templates](http://jinja.pocoo.org) for front-end rendering,
and [Sheer](https://github.com/cfpb/sheer) configurations for loading
content from the WordPress and Django back-ends through Elasticsearch.

**Technology stack**:
- Mac OSX.
- [Homebrew](http://brew.sh) - package manager for installing system software on Mac OSX.
- Python and PIP (Python package installer).
- WordPress API data source URL.

**This project is a work in progress.**
Nothing presented in this repo—whether in the source code, issue tracker,
or wiki—is a final product unless it is marked as such or appears on consumerfinance.gov.

## Dependencies
- [Sheer](https://github.com/cfpb/sheer):
  Web server used to serve the pages using [Jinja templates](http://jinja.pocoo.org).
  Sheer is a Jekyll-inspired, Elasticsearch-powered, CMS-less publishing tool.
- [Elasticsearch](http://www.elasticsearch.org):
  Used for full-text search capabilities and content indexing.
- [Node](http://nodejs.org) and NPM (Node Project Manager):
  Used for downloading and managing front-end dependencies and assets.

## Installation

#### 1. Back-end setup

Follow the [Sheer installation instructions](https://github.com/cfpb/sheer#installation)
to get Sheer installed.
**NOTE:** We suggest creating a virtualenv variable specific to this project,
such as `cfgov-refresh` instead of `sheer` used in the Sheer installation instructions:

```bash
$ mkvirtualenv cfgov-refresh
```

Install the following dependencies into your virtual environment.
We called ours `cfgov-refresh` (see previous step above):

```bash
$ workon cfgov-refresh

$ pip install git+git://github.com/dpford/flask-govdelivery
$ pip install git+git://github.com/rosskarchner/govdelivery
```

#### 2. Front-end setup

The cfgov-refresh front-end currently uses the following frameworks / tools:

- [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com): task management for pulling in assets,
  linting and concatenating code, etc.
- [Bower](http://bower.io): Package manager for front-end dependencies.
- [Less](http://lesscss.org): CSS pre-processor.
- [Capital Framework](https://cfpb.github.io/capital-framework/getting-started):
  User interface pattern-library produced by the CFPB.

**NOTE:** If you're new to Capital Framework, we encourage you to
[start here](https://cfpb.github.io/capital-framework/getting-started).

1. Install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) however you'd like.
2. Install [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com) and [Bower](http://bower.io):

```bash
$ npm install -g grunt-cli bower
```

## Configuration

The project needs a number of environment variables.
The project uses a WordPress API URL to pull in content
and GovDelivery for running the subscription forms:

- `WORDPRESS`(URL to WordPress install)
- `GOVDELIVERY_BASE_URL`
- `GOVDELIVERY_ACCOUNT_CODE` (GovDelivery account variable)
- `GOVDELIVERY_USER` (GovDelivery account variable)
- `GOVDELIVERY_PASSWORD` (GovDelivery account variable)
- `SUBSCRIPTION_SUCCESS_URL` (Forwarding location on Subscription Success)

> You can also export the above environment variables to your `.bash_profile`,
or use your favorite alternative method of setting environment variables.

**NOTE:** GovDelivery is a third-party web service that powers our subscription forms.
Users may decide to swap this tool out for another third-party service.
The application will function but throw an error if the above GovDelivery values are not set.

## Usage

Generally you will have four tabs (or windows) open in your terminal when using this project.
These will be used for:
 1. **Git operations**. Perform git operations and general development in the repository.
 2. **Elasticsearch**. Run Elasticsearch instance.
 3. **Sheer web server**. Run the web server.
 4. **Grunt watch**. Run Grunt watch task for watching for changes to content.

What follows are the specific steps for each of these tabs.

### 1. Clone project and pull in latest updates

Using Terminal, navigate to your project directory (`cd ~/Projects` or equivalent).
Clone the project with:

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:cfpb/cfgov-refresh.git
$ cd cfgov-refresh
```

Each time you fetch from the upstream repository (this repo),
you should install dependencies with NPM and `grunt vendor`,
then run `grunt` to rebuild everything:

```bash
$ npm install
$ npm update
$ grunt vendor
$ grunt
```

### 2. Run Elasticsearch

To launch Elasticsearch, first find out where your Elasticsearch config file is located.
You can do this with [Homebrew](http://brew.sh) using:

```bash
$ brew info elasticsearch
```

The last line of that output should be the command you need to launch Elasticsearch
with the proper path to its configuration file. For example, it may look like:

```
$ elasticsearch --config=/Users/[YOUR MAC OSX USERNAME]/homebrew/opt/elasticsearch/config/elasticsearch.yml
```

> You can add the following to your `.bash_profile` that will allow launching of Elasticsearch with the `elsup` command:
  ```
  $ alias elsup="elasticsearch --config=/Users/[MAC OSX USERNAME]/homebrew/opt/elasticsearch/config/elasticsearch.yml"
  ```


### 3. Launch Sheer to serve the site

To work on the app you will need Sheer running to compile the templates.
To do this, run the following:

```bash
# Use the sheer virtualenv.
$ workon sheer

# Index the latest content from the API output from a WordPress and Django back-end.
$ sheer index

# Start sheer.
$ sheer serve --debug
```

To view the site browse to: <http://localhost:7000>

To view the project layout docs and pattern library,
browse to <http://localhost:7000/docs>

To view the indexed content you can use a tool called
[elasticsearch-head](http://mobz.github.io/elasticsearch-head/).

**Using a different port:** If you want to run Sheer at a different port than 7000,
serve Sheer with the `--port` argument,
e.g. to run on port 7001 use `sheer serve --port 7001 --debug`.

### 4. Launch Grunt watch task

To watch for changes in the source code and automatically update the running site,
open a terminal and run:

```
$ grunt watch
```

*Alternatively, if you don't want to run the full watch task, there are two available
sub-tasks:*

``` bash
# Watch & compile CSS only
$ grunt watch:css

# Watch & compile CSS & JS only
$ grunt watch:cssjs
```

## How to test the software

To run browser tests, you'll need to perform the following steps:

1. Install chromedriver:
  - Mac: `brew install chromedriver`
  - Manual (Linux/Mac): Download the latest
    [Chromedriver](http://chromedriver.storage.googleapis.com/index.html)
    binary and put it somewhere on your path (e.g. `/path/to/your/venv/bin`)
2. In `_tests/browser_testing/features/`, copy `example-environment.cfg` to
`environment.cfg` and change the `chrome_driver` path to the proper path
for your webdriver binary.  If you installed via homebrew,
you can find the path with `brew info chromedriver`, which will give you
the chromedriver directory. Use this path, but include the chromedriver name at the end to target the executable, something like `/path/to/homebrew/bin/chromedriver`.
3. `pip install -r _tests/browser_testing/requirements.txt`
4. `cd _tests/browser_testing/`
5. Start the tests: `behave`

## Working with the templates
<!-- Perhaps we want to split this out into a separate page? -->
### Simple static template setup

By default, Sheer will render pages at their natural paths in the project's file structure.
For example, going to <http://localhost:7000/the-bureau/index.html>
(or <http://localhost:7000/the-bureau/>) renders `/the-bureau/index.html`
as processed by the [Jinja2](http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs) templating engine.
**NOTE:** This page does not automatically show any content indexed by Sheer;
it simply outputs the static HTML written into the template.

### Outputting indexed content in a Sheer template

Most of our content is indexed from the API output of our WordPress back-end.
This happens when the `sheer index` command is run.

There are two ways in which we use indexed content:
repeating items (e.g., blog posts and press releases),
and single pages (e.g., the Future Requests page in Doing Business with Us).
What follows is a deeper dive into both of these content types.

#### Repeating content

For any kind of repeating content, this is the basic process:

1. In the vars file for the section you're in (e.g., `blog/_vars-blog.html`),
  we set up a variable that holds the results of the default query we want to run.

  Here's how it looks for the blog:

  ```jinja
  {% set query = queries.posts %}
  {% set posts = query.search_with_url_arguments(size=10) %}
  ```

2. If you want to display the repeating content within a template,
  simply set up a `for ... in` loop,
  then output the different properties of the post within.
  In the case of the blog, a list of posts is built using this method in
  `_includes/posts-paginated.html`.

  Here is a simplified example:

  ```jinja
  {% for post in posts %}
    <h1>{{ post.title }}</h1>
    {{ post.content }}
  {% endfor %}
  ```

3. If you would like to display each instance of repeating content in a separate
  page, create a `_single.html` template (in the case of the blog,
  located at `blog/_single.html`) and a corresponding entry in `_settings/lookups.json`.
  Sheer will automatically create URLs for every post of that type and render
  them with the `_single.html` template.
  This is how separate pages are generated for each blog post.

#### Single content

To access a single piece of content,
the easiest thing to do is use the `get_document()` function.

Using the example given earlier of the Future Requests page,
here's how it's done:

```jinja
{% set page = get_document('pages', '63169') %}
{{ page.content | safe }}
```

This example pulls a WordPress page into a template.
We use the page post type (i.e., the built-in "Page" entries in WordPress)
when all or most of a page's content can be edited in WordPress.

**NOTE:** When accessing a WordPress page,
you must use the numeric ID to identify the page you want to get,
as multiple pages can have the same slug.
(This is also true of any custom post type that is hierarchical.)

The `get_document` method can be used to retrieve a single item of any post type
for display within a template.
In the below example from `contact-us/promoted-contacts.html`,
we get an instance of the non-hierarchical `contact` post type using its slug (`whistleblowers`):

```jinja
{% set whistleblowers = get_document('contact', 'whistleblowers') %}
```

In practice, many of our templates are a Frankenstein-type mixture
of hand-coded static content and calls to indexed content,
as we continually try to strike the right balance of what content
is appropriate to be edited by non-developers in WordPress,
and what is just too fragile to do any other way than by hand.

### Filtering results with queries

Sometimes you'll want to create queries in your templates to filter the data.

The two main ways of injecting filters into your data are in the URL's query
string and within the template code itself.

We have a handy function `search_with_url_arguments()` that:

1. Pulls in filters from the URL query string.
2. Allows you to add additional filters by passing them in as arguments to the function.

#### URL query string filters

URL query string filters can be further broken down into two types:

1. Term - Used when you want to filter by whether a field matches a term.  Note that in order
to use this type of filter, the field you are matching it against must have `"index": "not_analyzed"`
set in the mapping.
2. Range - Used for when you want to filter something by a range (e.g. dates or numbers)

An example of Term is:

`?filter_category=Op-Ed`

`filter_[field]=[value]`

When you go to a URL such as http://localhost:7000/blog/?filter_category=Op-Ed
and you use `search_with_url_arguments()`,
the queryset returned will only include objects with a category of 'Op-Ed'.

An example of Range is:

`?filter_range_date_gte=2014-01`

`filter_range_[field]_[operator]=[value]`

Continuing with the example above, if you go to a URL such as
`http://localhost:7000/blog/?filter_range_date_gte=2014-01`
and you use `search_with_url_arguments()`,
you'll get a queryset of objects where the 'date' field is in January, 2014, or later.

URL query string filters are convenient for many of the filtered queries you'll need to run,
but often there are cases where you'll need more flexibility.

#### More complex filters

By default, `search_with_url_arguments()` uses the default query parameters
defined in the `_queries/object-name.json` file,
then mixes them in with any additional arguments
from the URL query string in addition to what is passed into the function itself.

When using `search_with_url_arguments()`, you can also pass in filters with the same `filter_` syntax as above.

For example:

`search_with_url_arguments(filter_category='Op-Ed')`

Multiple term filters on the same field will be combined in an OR clause, while
term filters of different fields will be combined in an AND clause.

For example:

`search_with_url_arguments(filter_tag='Students', filter_tag='Finance', filter_author='Batman')`

This will return documents that have the tag Students OR Finance, AND have an author of Batman.

If you need more control over your filter than that, enter it manually in the _queries/filtername.json file.
