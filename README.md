# consumerfinance.gov

The primary repository for [consumerfinance.gov](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/).
This Django project includes the front-end assets and build tools,
[Jinja templates](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/) for front-end rendering,
code to configure our CMS, [Wagtail](https://wagtail.io/),
and several standalone Django apps for specific parts of the site.

## Quickstart

Full installation and usage instructions are available in
[our documentation](https://cfpb.github.io/consumerfinance.gov).

This project requires Python 3.6, Node 12, and Gulp 4.
We recommend the use of [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/) and
[virtualenvwrapper](https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
for keeping the project's Python dependencies contained.

Clone the repository:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:cfpb/consumerfinance.gov.git
```

Create a virtual environment for Python dependencies:

```sh
cd consumerfinance.gov
mkvirtualenv --python=python3.6 consumerfinance.gov
```

Create and load initial environment settings:

```sh
cp -a .env_SAMPLE .env
source .env
```

Install third-party dependencies and build frontend assets:

```sh
./setup.sh
```

Create a local database, a Wagtail admin user, and a site homepage:

```sh
./initial-data.sh
```

Start your local Django server:

```sh
./runserver.sh
```

Your site will be available locally at <http://localhost:8000/>.

The Wagtail admin area will be available at <http://localhost:8000/admin/>,
which you can log into with the credentials `admin`/`admin`.
