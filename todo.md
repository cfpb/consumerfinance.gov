# To do

- Better README, like OAH
- No "number of results" message on smaller screens
- BB wordwrap issue
- Green bar under header needs bg image
- Update CF components with patterns
  - Make utilities a component
  - Update cf-forms with the form patterns
  - Update cf-typography with some of the meta patterns and the summary

- Post stuff
  - Posts with annoying deks

    - /blog/understanding-reverse-mortgages
  - Posts with videos, might want to make them full-width using the
    .u-flexible-container utility

    - /blog/live-from-phoenix
    - /blog/remittance-rule-session

    at smaller screens
    - /blog/four-steps-you-can-take-if-you-think-your-credit-or-debit-card-data-was-hacked
  - Posts with hand-coded insets, might want to pull them out of the post and
    make them use the inset widget, also note that there is some style blocks
    used here which we should get rid of
