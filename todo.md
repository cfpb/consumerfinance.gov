# To do

- Better README, like OAH
- No "number of results" message on smaller screens
- BB wordwrap issue
- Green bar under header needs bg image
- Update CF components with patterns
  - Make utilities a component
  - Update cf-forms with the form patterns
  - Update cf-typography with some of the meta patterns and the summary
  - Move the cf tweaks from nav-secondary

- Post stuff
  - Posts with annoying deks
    - /blog/save-the-date-detroit-michigan
    - /blog/understanding-reverse-mortgages
  - Posts with videos, might want to make them full-width using the
    .u-flexible-container utility
    - /blog/live-from-atlanta
    - /blog/live-from-phoenix
    - /blog/remittance-rule-session
  - Posts with floating images, might want to make them flixble or stop floating
    at smaller screens
    - /blog/four-steps-you-can-take-if-you-think-your-credit-or-debit-card-data-was-hacked
  - Posts with hand-coded insets, might want to pull them out of the post and
    make them use the inset widget, also note that there is some style blocks
    used here which we should get rid of

- Scrum stuff
  - Hard to know what's ready for front end
  - Jira, stories VS tasks?
  - No cf updates

- Templating refactoring todos
  - document layout chain better in the layouts section
  - move layouts section to docs, probably rename to avoid conflict with Less layout docs
  - rename content_block to just block?
  - rename base layout .html files so visually it appears there are only a few layouts to choose
  - rename section_vars to section
  - look into relative imports: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8512677/how-to-include-a-template-with-relative-path-in-jinja2
