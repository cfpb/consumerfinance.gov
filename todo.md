- Green bar under header needs bg image
- Update CF components with patterns
  - Make utilities a component
  - Update cf-forms with the form patterns
  - Update cf-typography with some of the meta patterns and the summary
  - Move the cf tweaks from nav-secondary

  - Posts with hand-coded insets, might want to pull them out of the post and

    used here which we should get rid of
