# Running in Docker

First, follow
[the Docker installation instructions](../installation/#docker-based-installation)
to setup your Docker environment and create the project Docker containers.

We use [`docker-compose`](https://docs.docker.com/compose/reference/overview/)
to run an Elasticsearch container, a PostgreSQL container, 
and Django in a Python container. 
There is also a container serving the documentation. 

All of these containers are configured in our 
[`docker-compose.yml` file](https://github.com/cfpb/cfgov-refresh/blob/master/docker-compose.yml). 
See the [Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/) 
for more about the format and use of this file.

The following URLs are mapped to your host from the containers:

- Access cfgov-refresh running in the Python container: http://localhost:8000/
- Access Elasticsearch: http://localhost:9200/
- View this documentation: http://localhost:8888/

To build and run the containers for the first time, run:

```bash
docker-compose up
```


## Environment variables

Environment variables from your `.env` file are sourced 
when the Python container starts
and when you access the running Python container. 
Your local shell environment variables, however, 
are not visible to applications running in Docker.
To add new environment variables, simply add them to the `.env` file, 
stop docker-compose with Ctrl+C, 
and start it again with `docker-compose up`.


## Access a container's shell

- Python: `docker-compose exec python bash`
- Elasticsearch: `docker-compose exec elasticsearch bash`
- PostgreSQL: `docker-compose exec postgres bash`


## Run Django management commands

Django `manage.py` commands can only be run after you've 
opened up a shell in the Python container. 
From there commands like `cfgov/manage.py migrate` should run as expected.

The same goes for scripts like `./refresh-data.sh` and `./initial-data.sh` â€”
they will work as expected once you're inside the container.


## Update Python dependencies

If the Python package requirements files have changed, 
you will need to stop `docker-compose` (if it is running) 
and rebuild the Python container using:

```
docker-compose up --build python
```


## Work on satellite apps

See [Related Projects#Using Docker](../related-projects/#using-docker).


## Attach for debugging

If you have inserted a [PDB breakpoint](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pdb.html) in your code 
and need to interact with the running Django process when the breakpoint is reached 
you can run [`docker attach`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/attach/):

- `docker attach cfgov-refresh_python_1`

When you're done, you can detach with `Ctrl+P Ctrl+Q`.


## Useful Docker commands

For `docker-compose` commands, 
`[SERVICE]` is the service name that is defined in `docker-compose.yml`.

For `docker` commands, `[CONTAINER]` is the container name displayed with `docker ps`.

- [`docker ps`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/ps/)
    will list all containers.
- [`docker logs [CONTAINER]`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/logs/)
    will print the logs of a container.
- [`docker top [CONTAINER]`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/top/)
    will display the running processes in a container.
- [`docker-compose build [SERVICE]`](https://docs.docker.com/compose/reference/build/)
    will build any of our configured containers.


## Production-like Docker Image

This repository includes a "production-like" Docker image, created for
experimenting with how cf.gov _could_ be built and run as a Docker
container in production.

This includes:

- all relevant `cfgov-refresh` source code
- all OS, Python, and JS dependencies for building and running the cf.gov webapp
- procedures for executing Django `collectstatic` and `yarn`-based frontend build process
- an Apache HTTPD webserver with `mod_wsgi`, run with configs in `cfgov-refresh`

### How do I use it?

#### Just Docker

If you just want to build the image:

```bash
docker build . --build-arg scl_python_version=rh-python36 -t your-desired-image-name
```

**Note:** The `scl_python_version` build arg specifies which
[Python Software Collection](https://www.softwarecollections.org/en/scls/?search=python)
version you'd like to use. We've tested this against `rh-python36`.

#### Docker Compose

You can also launch the full cf.gov stack locally via `docker-compose`. This setup is
a nice way to test out new Apache config changes. It includes volumes that mount your
local checkout `cfgov/apache` config directories into the container, allowing you to
change configs locally without having to rebuild the image each time.

1. Launch the stack.

    ```bash
    docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.prod.yml up --build
    ```

    This creates a container running cf.gov on Python, as well as
    Postgres and Elasticsearch containers, much like the development environment.

1. Load the `cfgov` database (optional).  If you do not already have a running
    `cfgov` database, you will need to download and load it from within the container.

    ```bash
    docker-compose exec python bash

    # Once in the container...
    export CFGOV_PROD_DB_LOCATION=<database-dump-url>
    ./refresh-data.sh
    ```

1. Browse to your new local cf.gov site.

    http://localhost:8000


1. Adjust an Apache [`cfgov/apache`](https://github.com/cfpb/cfgov-refresh/tree/master/cfgov/apache)
   config and reload Apache (optional).

    ```bash
    docker-compose exec python bash

    # Once in the container...
    httpd -d ./cfgov/apache -k restart
    ```

1. Switch back to the development Compose setup.

    ```bash
    docker-compose rm -sf python
    docker-compose up --build python
    ```

### How does it work?

The production image extends the development image. If you look at the `Dockerfile`, this is spelled out by the line:

```
FROM cfgov-dev as cfgov-prod
```

Both 'cfgov-dev' and 'cfgov-prod' are called "[build stages](https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/multistage-build/)". That line means, "create a new stage, starting from cfgov-dev, called cfgov-prod".

From there, we:

- Install SCL-based Apache HTTPD, and the `mod_wsgi` version appropriate for our chosen `scl_python_version`.
- Run frontend.sh, Django's collectstatic command, and then *uninstall* node and yarn.
- Set the default command on container startup to `httpd -d ./cfgov/apache -D FOREGROUND`, which runs Apache using
    the [configuration in cfgov-refresh](https://github.com/cfpb/cfgov-refresh/tree/master/cfgov/apache), in the
    foreground (typical when running Apache in a container).
