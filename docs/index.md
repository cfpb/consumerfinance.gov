- [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) - package manager for installing system software on OSX
- [Python 3.6](https://docs.python.org/3.6/) and [pip (Python package manager)](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/user_guide/)
- [Jinja2 templates](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/) for front-end rendering. See [`requirements/libraries.txt`](https://github.com/cfpb/consumerfinance.gov/tree/main/requirements/libraries.txt) for version.
- [Wagtail CMS](https://wagtail.io) for content administration. See [`requirements/wagtail.txt`](https://github.com/cfpb/consumerfinance.gov/tree/main/requirements/wagtail.txt) for version.
- [PostgreSQL 10.5](https://www.postgresql.org/) is the database we use in production and locally.
- [Psycopg](http://initd.org/psycopg/) is the Python library that lets Python talk to Postgres. See [`requirements/libraries.txt`](https://github.com/cfpb/consumerfinance.gov/tree/main/requirements/libraries.txt) for current version.

## Additional dependencies

- [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co):
  Used for full-text search capabilities and content indexing.
- [Node 12](http://nodejs.org) and [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/):
  Used for downloading and managing front-end dependencies and assets. Front-end dependencies are listed in the project's [package.json](https://github.com/cfpb/consumerfinance.gov/blob/main/package.json) file.
- [Gulp 4](https://gulpjs.com/) for running tasks, including compiling front-end assets and running acceptance and unit tests.
- [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/)

## Versions

Versions for most front-end packages are kept updated in the project's [package.json](https://github.com/cfpb/consumerfinance.gov/blob/main/package.json) file.

Versions for back-end software including Django, Wagtail, Jinja, etc. are kept in the project's requirements files:
https://github.com/cfpb/consumerfinance.gov/tree/main/requirements

- `base.txt`: shortcut for `django.txt` + `wagtail.txt` + `libraries.txt`
- `ci.txt`: specific requirements for the continuous integration environment. Should/could be moved to CI configuration files?
- `deployment.txt`: requirements for deployment, includes `base.txt` and a New Relic library that we don't install anywhere else.
- `django.txt`: specifies the Django version. The file is used when running the site, but by having it separate we can test against other versions of Django by excluding this file.
- `docs.txt`: requirements to build the consumerfinance.gov docs.
- `libraries.txt`: Python libraries.
- `local.txt`: includes `base.txt` and some useful libraries when developing locally.
- `scripts.txt`: Requirements for running certain jobs on Jenkins, so scripts can run in Jenkins without having to install all the other requirements.
- `test.txt`: requirements for running Python tests.
- `wagtail.txt`: specifies Wagtail version. In its own file to make it easier to test multiple versions, same as with `django.txt`.
