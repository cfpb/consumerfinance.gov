# Introduction to cfgov-refresh

This is the documentation for the cfgov-refresh project, a redesign of the [www.consumerfinance.gov](https://www.consumerfinance.gov) website. It is organized thematically in order to create a central repository for all information pertaining to cfgov-refresh.

## Disclaimer

**This project is a work in progress.** Nothing presented in this repo—whether in the source code, issue tracker, or wiki—is a final product unless it is marked as such or appears on [www.consumerfinance.gov](https://www.consumerfinance.gov). In-progress updates may appear on [beta.consumerfinance.gov](https://beta.consumerfinance.gov).

## Technology stack

The standard technology stack for development of cfgov-refresh within the CFPB consists of the following base:

- macOS
- [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) - package manager for installing system software on OSX
- [Python 2.7](https://docs.python.org/2.7/) and [pip (Python package manager)](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/user_guide/)
- [Jinja2 templates](http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/2.10/) for front-end rendering. See [`requirements/libraries.txt`](https://github.com/cfpb/cfgov-refresh/tree/master/requirements/libraries.txt) for version.
- [Wagtail CMS](https://wagtail.io) for content administration. See [`requirements/wagtail.txt`](https://github.com/cfpb/cfgov-refresh/tree/master/requirements/wagtail.txt) for version.
- [PostgreSQL 10.5](https://www.postgresql.org/) is the database we use in production and locally.
- [Psycopg](http://initd.org/psycopg/) is the Python library that lets Python talk to Postgres. See [`requirements/postgres.txt`](https://github.com/cfpb/cfgov-refresh/tree/master/requirements/postgres.txt) for current version.

## Additional dependencies

- [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co):
  Used for full-text search capabilities and content indexing.
- [Node 8](http://nodejs.org) and [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/):
  Used for downloading and managing front-end dependencies and assets. Front-end dependencies are listed in the project's [package.json](https://github.com/cfpb/cfgov-refresh/blob/master/package.json) file.
- [Gulp 4](https://gulpjs.com/) for running tasks, including compiling front-end assets and running acceptance and unit tests.
- [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/)
- [virtualenvwrapper](https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

## Versions

Versions for most front-end packages are kept updated in the project's [package.json](https://github.com/cfpb/cfgov-refresh/blob/master/package.json) file.

Versions for back-end software including Django, Wagtail, Jinja, etc. are kept in the project's requirements files:
https://github.com/cfpb/cfgov-refresh/tree/master/requirements

- `base.txt`: shortcut for `django.txt` + `wagtail.txt` + `libraries.txt`
- `deployment.txt`: requirements for deployment, includes `base.txt` and `postgres.txt` and a New Relic library which we don't install anywhere else.
- `django.txt`: specifies the Django version. The file is used when running the site, but by having it separate we can test against other versions of Django by excluding this file.
- `libraries.txt`: Python libraries.
- `local.txt`: includes `base.txt` and `postgres.txt` and some useful libraries when developing locally.
- `docs.txt`: requirements to build the cfgov-refresh docs. 
- `optional-public.txt`: cfgov-refresh satellite apps. Should/could be moved into `libraries.txt`.
- `postgres.txt`: requirements to connect Django to Postgres.
- `scripts.txt`: Requirements for running certain jobs on Jenkins, so scripts can run in Jenkins without having to install all the other requirements.
- `test.txt`: requirements for running Python tests.
- `travis.txt`: extra requirements for Travis. Should/could be moved to explicitly listed in the .travis.yml file?
- `wagtail.txt`: specifies Wagtail version. In its own file to make it easier to test multiple versions, same as with `django.txt`.
