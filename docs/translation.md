# Translation

As cfgov-refresh is a Django project, the [Django translation documentation is a good place to start](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/topics/i18n/translation/). What follows is a brief introduction to translations with the particular tools cfgov-refresh uses (like Jinja2 templates) and the conventions we use.

## Overview

Django translations use [GNU gettext](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gettext) (see
[the installation instructions](installation.md#install-gnu-gettext-for-django-translation-support)).

By convention, translations are usually performed in code by wrapping a string to be translated in a function that is either named or aliased with an underscore. For example:

```python
_("This is a translatable string.")
```

These strings are collected into portable object (`.po`) files for each supported language. These files map the original string (`msgid`) to a matching translated string (`msgstr`). For example:

```po
msgid "This is a translatable string."
msgstr "Esta es una cadena traducible."
```

These portable object files are compiled into machine object files (`.mo`) that the translation system uses when looking up the original string.

By convention the `.po` and `.mo` files live inside a `locale/[LANGUAGE]/LC_MESSAGES/` folder structure, for example, `cfgov/locale/es/LC_MESSAGES/django.po` for the Spanish language portable object file for all of our cfgov-refresh messages.

## How to translate text in cfgov-refresh

This brief howto will guide you through adding translatable text to cfgov-refresh.

#### 1. Add the translation function around the string

In Jinja2 templates:

```jinja
{{ _('Hello World!') }}
```

In Django templates:

```django
{% load i18n %}

{% trans "Hello World!" %}
```

In Python code:

```python
from django.utils.translation import ugettext as _

mystring = _('Hello World!')
```

The string in the call to the translation function will be the `msgid` in the portable object file below.

#### 2. Run the `makemessages` management command to add the string to the portable object file

The `makemessages` management command will look through all Python, Django, and Jinja2 template files to find strings that are wrapped in a translation function call and add them to the portable object file for a particular language. The language is specified with `-l`. The command also must be called from the root of the Django app tree, *not* the project root.

To generate or update the portable object file for Spanish:

```shell
cd cfgov
django-admin.py makemessages -l es
```

#### 3. Edit the portable object file to add a translation for the string

The portable object files are stored in `cfgov/locale/[LANGUAGE]/LC_MESSAGES/`. For the Spanish portable object file, edit `cfgov/locale/es/LC_MESSAGES/django.po` and add the Spanish translation as the `msgstr` for your new `msgid`


```po
msgid "Hello World!"
msgstr "Hola Mundo!"
```

#### 4. Run the `compilemessages` management command to compile the machine object file

```shell
cd cfgov
django-admin.py compilemessages
```

## Wagtail Considerations

All of our Wagtail pages include a language-selection dropdown under its Configuration tab:

![Wagtail page language selection](img/wagtail-language.png)

The selected language will force translation of all translatable strings in templates and code for that page.
