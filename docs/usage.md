## Usage: Stand Alone

You will generally have three tabs (or windows) open in your terminal,
which will be used for:

 1. **Git operations**.
    Perform Git operations and general development in the repository,
    such as `git checkout master`.
 2. **Elasticsearch**.
    Run an Elasticsearch (ES) instance.
    See instructions [below](#2-run-elasticsearch-optional).
 3. **Django server**. Start and stop the web server.
    Server is started with `./runserver.sh`,
    but see more details [below](#3-load-indexes--launch-site).

What follows are the specific steps for each of these tabs.

### 1. Git operations

From this tab you can do Git operations,
such as checking out our master branch:

```bash
git checkout master
```

#### Updating all dependencies

Each time you fetch from the upstream repository (this repo), run `./setup.sh`.
This setup script will remove and reinstall the project dependencies
and rebuild the site's JavaScript and CSS assets.

!!! note
    You may also run `./backend.sh` or `./frontend.sh`
    if you only want to re-build the backend or front-end, respectively.

##### Setting environments

The `NODE_ENV` environment variable can be set in your `.env` file to either
`development` or `production`, which will affect how the build is made and what
gulp tasks are available. To install dependencies of one environment
or the other run `./frontend.sh` (dependencies and devDependencies)
or `./frontend.sh production` (dependencies but not devDependencies).

### 2. Run Elasticsearch (optional)

Elasticsearch is needed for certain pieces of this project but is not a
requirement for basic functionality.

If Elasticsearch is installed via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh), you can see
instructions for running manually or as a background service using:

```bash
brew info elasticsearch
```

Typically to run Elasticsearch as a background service you can run:

```bash
brew services start elasticsearch
```

### 3. Launch Site
First, move into the `cfgov-refresh` project directory
and ready your environment:

```bash
# Use the cfgov-refresh virtualenv.
workon cfgov-refresh

# cd into this directory (if you aren't already there)
cd cfgov-refresh
```

From the project root, start the Django server:

```bash
./runserver.sh
```

!!! note
    If prompted to migrate database changes,
    stop the server with `ctrl` + `c` and run these commands:

```bash
python cfgov/manage.py migrate
./initial-data.sh
./runserver.sh
```

To view the site browse to: <http://localhost:8000>

!!! note "Using a different port"
    If you want to run the server at a port other than 8000 use

    `python cfgov/manage.py runserver <port number>`

    Specify an alternate port number, e.g. `8001`.

To view the Wagtail admin login,
browse to <http://localhost:8000/admin> and login with username `admin`
and password `admin` (created in `initial-data.sh` above; note that this
password will expire after 60 days).

!!! note "Using HTTPS locally"
    To access a local server using HTTPS use

    `./runserver.sh ssl`

    You'll need to ignore any browser certificate errors.

#### Available Gulp Tasks
There are a number of important gulp tasks,
particularly `gulp build` and `gulp test`,
which will build the project and test it, respectively.
Using the `gulp --tasks` command you can view all available tasks.
The important ones are listed below:

```
gulp build           # Concatenate, optimize, and copy source files to the production /dist/ directory.
gulp clean           # Remove the contents of the production /dist/ directory.
gulp lint            # Lint the scripts and build files.
gulp docs            # Generate JSDocs from the scripts.
gulp test            # Run linting, unit and acceptance tests (see below).
gulp test:unit       # Run only unit tests on source code.
gulp test:acceptance # Run only acceptance (in-browser) tests on production code.
gulp audit           # Run code quality audits.
```

## Usage: Docker

Much of the guidance above for the "stand-alone" set-up still stands, and it
is worth reviewing in full. Here are some things that might be different:

- `docker-compose` takes care of running Elasticsearch for you, and all
Elasticsearch, Postgres, and Python output will be shown in a single Terminal
window or tab. (wherever you run `docker-compose up`)
- `manage.py` commands can only be run after you've opened up a terminal in the
Python container, which you can do with `./shell.sh`
- There is not *yet* a good way to use SSL/HTTPS, but that is in the works
- You won't ever need to use `backend.sh` or `runserver.sh`

### How do I...

#### Use Docker Machine

If you used `mac-virtualbox-init.sh`, then we used Docker Machine to create a
VirtualBox VM, running the Docker server. Here are some useful `docker-machine`
commands:

- Start and stop the VM with  `docker-machine start` and `docker-machine stop`
- get the current machine IP with `docker-machine ip`
- if for some reason you want to start over, `docker-machine rm default`, and
  `source mac-virtualbox-init.sh`

To enable Docker and Docker Compose commands, you'll always first need to run
this command in any new shell:

`eval $(docker-machine env)`

It may be helpful to run `docker-machine env` by itself, so you understand
what's happening. Those variables are what allows `docker-compose` and the
`docker` command line tool, running natively on your Mac, to connect to the
Docker server running inside VirtualBox.

If you use autoenv (described in the stand-alone intructions) or something
similar, you might consider adding `eval $(docker-machine env)` to your .env
file. You could also achieve the same results (and start the VM if it's not
running yet) with `source mac-virtualbox-init.sh`

Any further Docker documentation will assume you are either in a shell where
you have already run `eval $(docker-machine env)`, or you are in an environment
where that's not neccessary.

#### Run manage.py commands like migrate, shell, and dbshell, and shell scripts like refresh-data.sh

run `./shell.sh` to open up a shell *inside* the Python container. From there,
commands like `cfgov/manage.py migrate` should run as expected.

The same goes for scripts like `./refresh-data.sh` and `./initial-data.sh` â€“
they will work as expected once you're inside the container.

In addition you can run single commands by passing them as arguments to
`shell.sh`, for example:

`./shell.sh cfgov/manage.py migrate`

#### Use PDB

Run `./attach.sh` to connect to the TTY session where `manage.py runserver` is
running. If the app is paused at a PDB prompt, this is where you can access it.

#### Handle updates to Python requirements

If Compose is running, stop it with CTRL-C. Run:

`docker-compose build python`

This will update your Python image. The next time you run `docker-compose up`,
the new requirements will be in place.

#### Set environment variables

Your shell environment variables (and the variables in your .env file, if you
are using one) are not visible to applications running in Docker. If you need
to set variables that will be visible to Django, and in `./shell.sh`, you'll
need to set them in the .python_env file, and restart the python container (it
might be simpler to simple stop compose with ctrl-c, and start it again with
`docker-compose up`)

.python_env is *not* a shell script, like your .env file, ~/.bash_profile, etc.
See the [Docker Compose docs](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/#env_file)

#### Get familiar with Docker Compose, and our configuration

docker-compose.yml contains a sort of "recipe" for running the site. Each entry
in the Compose file describes a component of our application stack (Postgres,
Elasticsearch, and Python), and either points to a public image on Dockerhub,
or to a Dockerfile in cfgov-refresh. You can learn a lot more about Compose
files in [the docs](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/)

Similarly, a Dockerfile contains instructions for transforming some base image,
to one that suits our needs. The Dockerfile sitting in the top level of
cfgov-refresh is probably the most interesting. It starts with
[the public CentOS:7 image](https://hub.docker.com/_/centos/), and installs
everything else neccessary to run our Python dependencies and the Django app
itself.  This file will only be executed:

- the first time you run `docker-compose up` (or the first time after you
re-create the Docker Machine VM)
- any time you run `docker-compose build`

That's why you need to run `docker-compose build` after any changes to
/requirements/

There are other compose subcommands you might be interested in. Consider
[learning about](https://docs.docker.com/compose/reference/overview/)
`build`, `restarts`, `logs`, `ps`, `top`, and the `-d` option for `up`.

#### Develop satellite apps

Check out any apps you are developing into the develop-apps directory. These
will automatically be added to the
[PYTHONPATH](https://docs.python.org/2/using/cmdline.html#envvar-PYTHONPATH),
and apps contained within will be importable from Python running in the
container.

For example, if your app is called 'foobar', in a repo called foobar-project,
you could clone foobar-project in to develop apps:

`git clone https://github.com/myorg/foobar-project`

... which will create a directory at develop-apps/foobar-project. Assuming
'foobar' is at the top-level of 'foobar-project', you should be able to
import it from your python code:

```python
import foobar
```
#### runserver has crashed! How do I start it again

In a separate terminal window or tab, running `docker-compose up python` should
restart the server.
