# Browser tests

## Quick start:

To run browser tests, open a new Terminal window or tab and change to the project directory,
then tell gulp to start the tests:

```sh
gulp build
gulp test:acceptance ( tox -e acceptance can be run as well )
```

There are several options you can pass to run a particular suite of tests,
to run a particular list of features,
and/or to run it in "fast" mode:

```sh
gulp test:acceptance --suite=wagtail-admin ( runs just the wagtail-admin suite )
gulp test:acceptance --specs=multi-select.feature ( runs just the multi-select feature )
gulp test:acceptance --tags=@mobile ( runs all scenarios tagged with @mobile )
gulp test:acceptance --fast ( runs the tests without recreating the virtual environment )
```

The same options can be used with tox (--omitted):

```sh
tox -e acceptance suite=wagtail-admin
tox -e acceptance specs=multi-select.feature
tox -e acceptance tags=@mobile
tox -e acceptance-fast
```

These tests will run on their own server; you do not need to be running your development server.


## Sauce Connect - send tests to the cloud

!!! danger
    The instruction for automatically
    running Sauce Connect from gulp are not working.
    See https://github.com/cfpb/cfgov-refresh/issues/2324

Sauce Labs can be used to run tests remotely in the cloud.

1. Log into [http://saucelabs.com/account](http://saucelabs.com/account).

2. [Download Sauce Connect](https://docs.saucelabs.com/reference/sauce-connect/#basic-setup)

3. Open a new Terminal window or tab and navigate to the downloaded SauceConnect folder.
    If you place the folder in your Application's folder this might look like:

    ```
    cd /Users/<YOUR MAC OSX USERNAME>/Applications/SauceConnect
    ```

4. Copy step 3 from the the SauceLabs
   [Basic Setup instructions](https://wiki.saucelabs.com/display/DOCS/Basic+Sauce+Connect+Setup#BasicSauceConnectSetup-SettingUpSauceConnect)
   and run that in your Terminal window.
   Once you see `Sauce Connect is up` in the Terminal,
   that means the tunnel has successfully been established

    > The Terminal command should already have your Sauce username and access key filled in.
      If it doesn't, make sure you're logged in.

5. Update and uncomment the `SAUCE_USERNAME`, `SAUCE_ACCESS_KEY`,
   and `SAUCE_SELENIUM_URL` values in your `.env` file.
   The access key can be found in lower-left on the Sauce Labs
   [account profile page](https://saucelabs.com/account/profile).

6. Reload the settings with `cd .. && cd cfgov-refresh`. Type `y` if prompted.

7. Run the tests with `gulp test:acceptance`.

    !!! Note:
        If you want to temporarily disable testing on Sauce Labs,
        run the command as: `gulp test:acceptance --sauce=false`.

8. Monitor progress of the tests
   on the [Sauce Labs dashboard](https://saucelabs.com/dashboard) Automated Tests tab.

!!! Note
    If you get the error `Error: ENOTFOUND getaddrinfo ENOTFOUND`
    while running a test, it likely means that Sauce Connect is not running.
    See step 4 above.

## Manual test configuration

A number of command-line arguments can be set to test particular configurations:

 - `--suite`: Choose a particular suite or suites to run.
   For example, `gulp test:acceptance --suite=content` or `gulp test:acceptance --suite=content,functional`.
 - `--specs`: Choose a particular spec or specs to run.
   For example, `gulp test:acceptance --specs=contact-us.js`, `gulp test:acceptance --specs=contact-us.js,about-us.js`, or `gulp test:acceptance --specs=foo*.js`. If `--suite` is specified, this argument will be ignored. If neither `--suite` nor `--specs` are specified, all specs will be run.
 - `--windowSize`: Set the window size in pixels in `w,h` format.
   For example, `gulp test:acceptance --windowSize=900,400`.
 - `--browserName`: Set the browser to run.
   For example, `gulp test:acceptance --browserName=firefox`.
 - `--version`: Set the browser version to run.
   For example, `gulp test:acceptance --version='44.0'`.
 - `--platform`: Set the OS platform to run.
   For example, `gulp test:acceptance --platform='osx 10.10'`.
 - `--sauce`: Whether to run on Sauce Labs or not.
   For example, `gulp test:acceptance --sauce=false`.


## Tests

Tests are organized into suites under the `test/browser_tests/cucumber/features` directory. Any new tests should be added to an existing suite (e.g. "default"), or placed into a new suite directory. All tests start with writing a `.feature` spec in one of these suites, and then adding corresponding step definitions, found in `test/browser_tests/cucumber/step_definitions`.

# Performance testing

To audit if the site complies with performance best practices and guidelines,
run `gulp test:perf`.

The audit will run against
[Google's PageSpeed Insights](https://github.com/addyosmani/psi).


# Django and Python unit tests

To run the the full suite of Python 2.7 unit tests using Tox, cd to the project
root, make sure the `TOXENV` variable is set in your `.env` file and then run

```
tox
```

If you haven't changed any installed packages and you don't need to test all migrations, you can run a much faster Python code test using:
```
tox -e fast
```

To see Python code coverage information, run
```
./show_coverage.sh
```


# Accessibility Testing

Run the acceptance tests with an `--a11y` flag (i.e. `gulp test:acceptance --a11y`)
to check every webpage for WCAG and Section 508 compliancy using Protractor's
[accessibility plugin](https://github.com/angular/protractor-accessibility-plugin).

If you'd like to audit a specific page, use `gulp test:a11y`:

  1. Enable the environment variable `ACHECKER_ID` in your `.env` file.
     Get a free [AChecker API ID](http://achecker.ca/register.php) for the value.
  2. Reload your `.env` with `source ./.env` while in the project root directory.
  3. Run `gulp test:a11y` to run an audit on the homepage.
  4. To test a page aside from the homepage, add the `--u=<path_to_test>` flag.
     For example, `gulp test:a11y --u=contact-us`
     or `gulp test:a11y --u=the-bureau/bureau-structure/`.

# Source code linting

The default test task includes linting of the JavaScript source, build,
and test files.
Use the `gulp lint` command from the command-line to run the ESLint linter,
which checks the JavaScript against the rules configured in `.eslintrc`.
[See the ESLint docs](http://eslint.org/docs/rules/)
for detailed rule descriptions.

There are a number of options to the command:

 - `gulp lint:build`: Lint only the gulp build scripts.
 - `gulp lint:test`: Lint only the test scripts.
 - `gulp lint:scripts`: Lint only the project source scripts.
 - `--fix`: Add this flag (like `gulp lint --fix` or `gulp lint:build --fix`)
   to auto-fix some errors, where ESLint has support to do so.
