# We want to test collectstatic, but we might not have webfont files if this
# script is running somewhere public like on Travis CI. Because cfgov-refresh
# uses the Django ManifestStaticFilesStorage backend, the collectstatic command
# will fail if any referenced files are missing.
#
# Builds generated with webfont files place them in a static.in/0/fonts
# subdirectory. Builds generated without these files don't have this directory.
#
# If we don't have the webfont files, we create empty files with the same name
# to allow collectstatic to run successfully. If the files already exist, these
# commands do nothing.

# 1. Use grep to find all .woff and .woff2 files referenced in CSS files.
# 2. Reduce these to a list of unique webfont filenames.
# 3. Touch each filename in static.in/0/fonts, causing it to be created as an
# empty file if it doesn't exist already.
