    <h1>Small businesses & minorities</h1>
    <p class="h3">
        We offer information here to help small, women-owned, and minority-owned businesses particpate in the
        procurement and award process. We also publish information about existing awards to Small Business
        Administration-designated business classes. We are dedicated to working with small business
        owners—particularly women, minorities, and service-disabled veterans—and we welcome feedback about how
        we're doing.
