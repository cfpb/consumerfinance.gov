    <h1>Procurement History</h1>
    <p class="h3">
        Each year, we publish information about our contracts and awards from the preceding fiscal year.
        This can be helpful in understanding the kinds of products and services we procure and how that may
        change over time. In recent years, we have published three procurement review documents: a summary
        worksheet of our largest awards, an inventory of all of our service contracts, and a memo to the
        Office of Management and Budget that describes any planned analysis. For other types of financial
        information,
        <a href="/budget/">see our budget and strategy</a>.
