All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## How this repo is versioned

We use an adaptation of [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](http://semver.org).
Given the `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` pattern, here is how we decide to increment:

- The MAJOR number will be incremented for major redesigns that require the user
  to relearn how to accomplish tasks on the site.
- The MINOR number will be incremented when new content or features are added.
- The PATCH number will be incremented for all other changes that do not rise
  to the level of a MAJOR or MINOR update.
